/**
 * The {@code qits} command. With no command named, it shows what there is.
 * <p>
 * The help texts of all commands are the one source of SKILL.md ({@code qits help skill}). The
 * first description line here is its trigger, and the footer is its platform rules.
 * <p>
 * The tree here is every command but {@code qits tui}, which needs a terminal and lives with the
 * binary. The binary names this class as its top command ({@code quarkus.picocli.top-command}) and
 * puts {@code tui} back in its place, before {@code help} ({@code QitsCommandLine}), so the binary's
 * tree and its help are what they were when this was one module.
