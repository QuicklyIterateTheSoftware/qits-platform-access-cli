     * asked on its own, by the same rule, at every depth:

     * own history holds that commit. This matters in a project agent container, where every
     * submodule sits detached at its gitlink and that commit was often fetched by its id alone,
     * because a release tag reaches {@code main} only when the request is finalized; no ref in the
     * submodule holds it, and refusing there would freeze the checkout for good. The gitlink is
     * read from the parent's index, which equals the parent's {@code HEAD} here, since a staged
     * gitlink has already been refused in the parent.</li>
     * </ul>
     * Then the submodules that submodule's own {@code .gitmodules} declares, and that are
     * initialised, are asked the same way, down to {@link #MAX_SUBMODULE_DEPTH}.
     * <p>
     * A submodule at another commit that a ref holds is not work — the move puts it back at the
     * gitlink and the commit stays reachable — and neither is an untracked file, at any depth.
     * Every entry of the wrapper sets {@code ignore = all}, and so does every nested webui entry,
     * which Git's status honours, so asking inside each submodule is what keeps that work visible.
     * Asking inside a submodule with {@code --ignore-submodules=none}, as this did until qits-290,
     * reported a nested submodule that was merely at another commit, or held only untracked files,
     * as a change of its parent: after any nested bump the next release was refused for good.
     * <p>
     * {@code --ignore-submodules=all} also hides a staged gitlink, which {@code git add -A}
     * produces without a word under {@code ignore = all}. That is a tracked change, so the staged
