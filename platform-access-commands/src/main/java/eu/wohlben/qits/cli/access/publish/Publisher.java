/**
 * The three publishes and the existence probe — and, in one place, <b>the one idempotency policy</b>
 * this repository exists to hold.
 *
 * <h2>The policy</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>Publish if absent, verify if occupied, and never let a coordinate come to mean different
 * bytes.</b> Concretely, for every publish below:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Absent</b> — PUT, and say what landed.
 *   <li><b>Occupied with the same bytes</b> — success, with a line saying so. A release run
 *       re-fires, a rebootstrap replays a tag, a step is retried after a later failure: all three
 *       must go green, because the coordinate holds exactly what this run was asked to put there.
 *   <li><b>Occupied with different bytes</b> — hard failure naming both digests. This is the rule the
 *       whole policy is for. Publishing is allowed to add a coordinate and never to redefine one, so
 *       a run that would need to redefine one has found a real disagreement — two builds of one
 *       version — and the only honest thing to do is stop and show the two digests.
 *   <li><b>Occupied and the bytes cannot be compared</b> — skip, with a WARN naming the degradation.
 *       Exactly one surface is in this state today (docs: the store explodes a bundle into per-file
 *       blobs and keeps no archive digest), and the WARN is what stops that being mistaken for case
 *       2.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Anything else — a 4xx that is not the store's "already there", a 5xx, an unreadable body — fails
 * with the status and an excerpt of what came back. A 4xx is {@link ExitCode#POLICY} because the
 * request was wrong; a 5xx is {@link ExitCode#TRANSPORT} because the question was fine and the answer
 * was not.
 *
 * <h2>Why the three surfaces need three shapes</h2>
 *
 * <p>The store answers an occupied coordinate three different ways on purpose, and the policy is the
 * same across all three because it is expressed here rather than in each caller:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>sboms</b> answer <b>200</b> with {@code alreadyPublished} and the <em>stored</em> digest.
 *       One request settles it; no probe is needed.
 *   <li><b>daemons</b> answer <b>409</b>. A HEAD then supplies {@code Docker-Content-Digest}, and the
 *       comparison happens on that.
 *   <li><b>docs</b> answer <b>409</b> and expose no bundle digest at all, at any route. That is case
 *       4.
 * </ul>
