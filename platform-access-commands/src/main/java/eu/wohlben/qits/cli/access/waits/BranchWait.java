/**
 * {@code qits wait branch}: wait on one's own work by the branch it is on, not by the release
 * request that happens to carry it now (epic qits-1676). A request id goes stale when the request
 * refolds or is superseded; the branch does not. qits-projects publishes {@code
 * BranchDeliveryChanged} for every step a branch takes, and this preset selects on it.
 * <p>
 * Before declaring it reads the branch's deliveries once, so a step that already happened is said
 * at once instead of waited on forever. An event that lands between the read and the declaration
 * is caught by qits-workspaces' look-back (qits-1668).
