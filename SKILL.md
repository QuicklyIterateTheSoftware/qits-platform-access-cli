name: qits
description: "Use for any work on the qits platform from a terminal: signing in, projects and repositories, work items of every archetype (epics, tickets, features, tasks, campaigns) and their comment threads, release requests, CI runs and their logs, domain events, live telemetry, waiting on the platform, workspaces and their agents, Git pushes to the platform's git host, and publishing release artifacts from a CI step."
---

# qits

Each command calls the platform through its edge, with the session of `qits login`, except `qits artifacts publish`, which runs in a CI step container with no person and never touches that session. `qits <command> --help` shows a command's options, examples and exit codes.

A workspace is the token home: on a runner node, or an admin or editor workspace placed directly on qits-containers, with QITS_TOKEN set every command sends that token as it is, to the public vhosts https://<app>.qits.<QITS_DOMAIN>. It wins over the session and the commissioned pair, nothing is minted or written to disk, and a 401 means the token was deleted with the workspace's container. QITS_URL_<APP> still overrides an address.

## Platform rules

- Sign in once with `qits login`, and keep `qits session-daemon` running so the session stays fresh.
- Release only through a release request: `qits release-request create`, or `join` to add a branch to an open one. A push releases nothing.
- Push only branches under refs/heads/external/, after `qits git-login`. Git gets the token from `qits git-credential`.
- qits never prints a token. The two exceptions are `qits git-credential get`, which Git runs, and `qits mcp-credential`, which Claude runs. Two commands print a secret meant for one person: `qits users invite` (a register token) and `qits users register` (the new password, once).
- To wait for something on the platform, declare it with `qits wait` and end your turn: you get a new turn when it happens. Never poll for it in a background loop.
- A command that says `Not signed in` or `Session ended` exits with 2: run `qits login`.

## Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits login

Sign in through the browser and store the session. Run it first, and again when a command says `Not signed in` or `Session ended`.

The session goes to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/qits/t.json (default ~/.config/qits/t.json). The page shows a code: paste it at `Paste the code:`. The codes of one sign-in last 5 minutes.

```
qits login [--idp-url <url>] [--no-browser]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--idp-url <url>` | The idp's public base URL. Default: QITS_IDP_URL, else https://idp.qits.<QITS_DOMAIN>/idp, else https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp. |
| `--no-browser` | Only print the sign-in address; do not start a browser. |

### Examples

```
qits login
qits login --idp-url https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp
qits login --no-browser
```

Over SSH, use --no-browser and open the printed address on a machine with a browser.

### Exit codes

- `0` Signed in; the session is stored.
- `1` The sign-in did not complete.
- `2` Used wrongly.

## qits session-daemon

Keep the session from `qits login` fresh for as long as this runs. Start it once per workstation and leave it running.

It refreshes the access token shortly before it expires and writes the new pair to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/qits/t.json. It logs one line per event to stderr, and stops on SIGTERM or SIGINT.

```
qits session-daemon [--margin <seconds>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--margin <seconds>` | Refresh this many seconds before the access token expires, 0 to 300. Default: 30. |

### Examples

```
qits session-daemon &
systemctl --user enable --now qits-session-daemon
```

- The systemd unit is in the README. Only one daemon runs at a time; a second one exits with 1.
- When the session ends (revoked or expired), it says so, keeps running, and carries on after the next `qits login`.
- Without it, a command refreshes an access token that is about to expire before it calls the platform.

### Exit codes

- `0` Stopped by SIGTERM or SIGINT.
- `1` Another qits session-daemon is running.
- `2` --margin is not between 0 and 300.

## qits checkout-daemon

Hold a local checkout at what a repository released, and keep it there. It follows the releases, never the tips of the branches: the root ends detached at the release tag, and every submodule detached at the gitlink that release recorded. That tree is the estate somebody reviewed and released, which is not the same thing as `latest`.

It brings the checkout to the newest release at the start, then waits on the live event stream for a release request of the repository to be finalized (ReleaseRequestStateChanged to FINALIZED), never for the tag alone. After every connect it reads the newest one back, so a release finalized while it was stopped or reconnecting is not missed, and a release older than the one it holds never moves it back. Notes go to stderr, and every release it moves the checkout to is one line on stdout. Stops on SIGINT or SIGTERM.

```
qits checkout-daemon [--events-url <url>] [--once] [--path <dir>] [--repository <name>] [--submodules]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--events-url <url>` | The events service's base URL, without /events. Default: QITS_EVENTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `events`. |
| `--once` | Bring the checkout to the newest release and exit; do not open the stream. |
| `--path <dir>` | The checkout to hold. Default: the directory the command runs in. |
| `--repository <name>` | Whose releases to follow. Default: the repository the checkout's origin names. |
| `--submodules` | Hold the submodules at the gitlinks the release recorded. --no-submodules holds the root alone. Default: true. |

### Examples

```
qits checkout-daemon --path /workspace
qits checkout-daemon --path /workspace --once
qits checkout-daemon --path /srv/qits --repository qits-qits --no-submodules
```

- A checkout with local changes is never touched: it is somebody's work. It says so and keeps watching; with --once that is exit code 1. It never stashes, resets or merges.
- Git authentication stays the credential helper's: run `qits git-login` on a workstation, and in a container the injected host (QITS_GIT_AUTH_HOST) answers. No token is ever put in a URL.
- --repository is needed when the origin addresses the repository by its id (/git/<repository id>), which is the git host's internal storage scheme and names nothing.

### Exit codes

- `0` Stopped by SIGINT or SIGTERM, --once is done, or stdout was closed.
- `1` The platform refused the stream (401, 403 or another 4xx), or with --once the checkout has local changes or a git command failed.
- `2` Used wrongly (the origin names no repository and --repository was not given), Git has no credential for the origin's host, not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits projects

The platform's projects: list shows them, delivery shows one's delivery desk. Other commands take a project's id, slug or name as --project.

## qits projects list

List the projects: slug, name and id.

```
qits projects list [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |

### Examples

```
qits projects list
qits projects list -o json
```

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits projects delivery

A project's delivery desk: whether its front desk runs the delivery loop, how many items it keeps running at once, whether it may move a REFINED item to READY_FOR_DEV itself, the approvals it may give, and how often the loop ticks.

The project's wrapper declares it in .config/qits/project.yml under front_desk.delivery. A setting it does not declare prints as the default, marked (default).

```
qits projects delivery [--output table|json] [--project <project>] [--projects-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--project <project>` | The project (required): its id, slug or name. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |

### Examples

```
qits projects delivery --project qits
qits projects delivery --project qits -o json
```

- -o json prints the project's delivery object as the service sent it, null when it sent none.

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example no --project, or one the platform does not know), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits repositories

The repositories of one project: list shows them, create stands a new one up. Release requests take a repository's id or name as --repository.

branches, commits, commit-changes, commit-diff and commit-subjects read one repository's git history; each takes the repository as --repository <id or name>.

remote-login attaches this terminal to a repository's backup-remote sign-in, where git asks for the credentials the project's backups push with.

A repository's archetype is read off its name's role suffix, so the name is what says what kind of component it is. There is no flag for the archetype, on purpose.

## qits repositories list

List the project's repositories: name, archetype, component and id. --project may come before or after list.

```
qits repositories list [--output table|json] [--project <project>] [--projects-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--project <project>` | The project: its id, slug or name. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |

### Examples

```
qits repositories --project qits list
qits repositories list --project qits -o json
```

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits repositories create

Create a repository in the project: a blank one on the platform's git host, seeded with the repository template, and mounted in the project's wrapper.

The NAME says what kind of component it is: the service reads the archetype off the name's role suffix (payments-daemon is a DAEMON), and there is no flag to state one, because a flag could contradict the name. Name the repository <component>[-<modifier>]-<role>.

--component places the wrapper entry at components/<component>/<name>. Without it the wrapper's own layout decides.

```
qits repositories create [--component <component>] [--output table|json] [--project <project>] [--projects-url <url>] <name>
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `<name>` | The repository's name, and with it its kind: it ends in a role suffix, and that suffix is what the archetype is read from. It is also what ../<name>.git resolves to. |
| `--component <component>` | The technical component to mount the entry under: components/<component>/<name>. Default: the wrapper's own layout decides. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--project <project>` | The project: its id, slug or name. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |

### Examples

```
qits repositories --project qits create qits-docs-app --component qits-docs
qits repositories create qits-payments-service --project qits --component qits-payments
qits repositories --project qits create qits-docs-app -o json
```

- Roles: -service, -frontend, -app, -daemon, -oci, -cli, -javalib, -jslib. A name that carries none of them is refused by the service, because a guessed kind is the one thing nothing downstream could correct.
- Creating a repository needs the role qits:admin or qits:agent.
- The command prints what the service answered: the name, the archetype it derived, the component, the id, and the wrapper path the entry was written at.

### Exit codes

- `0` The repository exists and the wrapper names it.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status and what to do next), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits repositories branches

List a repository's branches: each with its parent, how far it is ahead of and behind that parent, and whether it can be cleaned up (fully merged, nothing depends on it).

Reads GET /projects/api/repositories/{id}/branches.

```
qits repositories branches [--output table|json] [--project <project>] [--projects-url <url>] [--repository <repository>]
```

| Name | What it does |

| `--project <project>` | The project: its id, slug or name. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |
| `--repository <repository>` | The repository (required): its id or name. |

### Examples

```
qits repositories --project qits branches --repository qits-ci-service
```

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits repositories commits

List the commits on a branch that are not on its parent, newest first, each with the files it changed.

Reads GET /projects/api/repositories/{id}/commits?branch=<branch>. The table shows hash, date, author, file count and subject; -o json adds the full message, the files and the parents.

- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits repositories commit-changes

List the files one commit changed against its first parent, or against --parent: path, old path for a rename, and change type.

Reads GET /projects/api/repositories/{id}/commits/{hash}/changes. Use commit-diff for one file's diff.

```
qits repositories commit-changes [--commit <hash>] [--output table|json] [--parent <hash>] [--project <project>] [--projects-url <url>] [--repository <repository>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--commit <hash>` | The commit (required): its full or short hash. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |

- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits repositories commit-diff

Print the unified diff of one file in one commit, against the same base as commit-changes. A binary file or a pure rename has an empty diff.

Reads GET /projects/api/repositories/{id}/commits/{hash}/diff?path=<path>.

```
qits repositories commit-diff [--commit <hash>] [--output table|json] [--parent <hash>] [--path <path>] [--project <project>] [--projects-url <url>] [--repository <repository>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--commit <hash>` | The commit (required): its full or short hash. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |

- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits repositories commit-subjects

Count how many of a branch's newest commits name their subject as term(<project>-<n>): message, for example feat(qits-1337): add the export, and list the ones that do not.

Reads GET /projects/api/repositories/{id}/commit-subjects. Each commit is EXEMPT (a merge, or a platform machine author such as a bump or release commit), COMPLYING or NON_COMPLYING. guard says whether the branch opts into the git host's subject guard (.config/qits/commit-subjects.yml holding enforce: true).

```
qits repositories commit-subjects [--branch <branch>] [--limit <n>] [--output table|json] [--project <project>] [--projects-url <url>] [--repository <repository>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--branch <branch>` | The branch to read. Default: the repository's main branch. |
| `--limit <n>` | How many of the newest commits to read. Default 100, at most 1000. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--project <project>` | The project: its id, slug or name. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |
| `--repository <repository>` | The repository (required): its id or name. |

### Examples

```
qits repositories --project qits commit-subjects --repository qits-ci-service
qits repositories --project qits commit-subjects --repository qits-ci-service --branch ticket/x --limit 20
```

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits repositories remote-login

Attach this terminal to a repository's backup-remote sign-in: the server runs an interactive git push to the backup remote, and git's username and password prompts come here. What you answer fills the credential store every backup of the project pushes with, so one sign-in fixes every repository whose last backup says AUTH_REQUIRED.

Without --repository it is the project repository (the one whose .gitmodules names the others), as the project page's Backups panel uses: what the sign-in authenticates is the host, not the repository. The repository needs a backup remote.

Ctrl-] detaches; the sign-in waits about a minute for you to attach again (run the same command), and the server replays what the terminal held. Every other key goes to git. A dropped connection attaches again after 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 4 s.

When the sign-in ends (git exits, or the server refuses in the terminal, for example because a push is already running), it asks for every backup of the project to run again (POST /projects/api/projects/{id}/repositories/backup-sync), waits 3 s and prints each repository's last backup. The pushes run in the background, so a result still says AUTH_REQUIRED until its push has run: ask again with `qits repositories list -o json`.

With stdin not a terminal it only streams what the terminal prints: nothing is typed.

WS /projects/api/repositories/{id}/remote-login. Needs qits:admin or qits:admin-agent, a person's token; qits:agent is refused.

```
qits repositories remote-login [--output table|json] [--project <project>] [--projects-url <url>] [--repository <repository>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--project <project>` | The project: its id, slug or name. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |
| `--repository <repository>` | The repository whose backup remote to sign in to: its id or name. Default: the project repository. |

### Examples

```
qits repositories remote-login --project qits
qits repositories remote-login --project qits --repository qits-ci-service
```

- git asks for a username and a password: give a scoped personal access token, not the account's password. Nothing is echoed at the password prompt.
- Not an MCP tool: it needs a terminal and runs until the sign-in ends.

### Exit codes

- `0` The sign-in ended and the backups were asked to run again, you detached (Ctrl-]), or it was stopped (SIGINT, SIGTERM). A 0 does not say the sign-in worked: the backups say that.
- `1` The platform refused (the socket or the backups), the repository has no backup remote, or the connection dropped and five attempts to attach again failed.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits work

Work items of every archetype - epics, tickets, features, tasks and campaigns - and their comment threads. list shows a project's items, details shows one with its comments and children, create files one, update edits its fields, transition reshapes it into another archetype, status moves it along its lifecycle, block and unblock flag that its phase cannot go on, delete removes it, dispatch puts an agent on it, and comment writes to its thread.

An epic's or a ticket's dossier (dossier), a campaign's members and progress (members, progress), its refinement room itself (refinement: open, show, discard) and the HTML designs of a refinement (design) are here too.

A write reads its payload, a JSON document, on stdin. With nothing on stdin (a terminal, or empty) it sends nothing and prints its usage and the payload's JSON schema instead, served by the service for that archetype.

Every archetype has a lifecycle: REPORTED, REFINED, READY_FOR_DEV, IMPLEMENTING, IMPLEMENTED, VERIFYING, VERIFIED, DONE, and DROPPED for work a decision was taken not to do, with an outcome saying why (status names them). Features and tasks walk the same nine words as epics and tickets; campaigns keep a shorter walk and never enter IMPLEMENTING or VERIFYING. A SKIP transition lets READY_FOR_DEV move straight to IMPLEMENTED, bypassing IMPLEMENTING, and IMPLEMENTED move straight to VERIFIED, bypassing VERIFYING. IMPLEMENTING only moves forward or drops; it never moves back. REFINED to READY_FOR_DEV needs a person - a person's own `qits` CLI sign-in, or the browser; an agent credential is refused. `status` names the moves open from where an item stands.

### Notes

- --entity, --output and --projects-url may come before or after the command.
- --entity is the item's qualified id (qits-100) or its id, sent to the service as it is; the service resolves either. So is every id inside a payload (parent, membership.parent, supersededBy, dependsOn).
- Reading takes qits:admin or qits:agent; so does writing, except an epic's status move, which takes qits:admin. An agent writes only in its own project.
- REFINED to READY_FOR_DEV takes a person signed in with their own `qits` CLI or the browser; an agent credential is refused (HTTP 409, or HTTP 403 for an epic).

## qits work list

A project's work items, every archetype, in the service's order: id (qualified), archetype, status, title and when it last changed. BLOCKED appears when a ticket is: yes for an explicit block, waiting when the only reason is an agent session sitting idle, and - when it is not blocked. A DROPPED item shows its outcome beside the status: DROPPED (DUPLICATE).

Each filter narrows the list; without one it shows everything.

```
qits work list [--archetype <archetype>] [--entity <entity>] [--outcome <outcome>] [--output table|json] [--parent <entity>] [--project <project>] [--projects-url <url>] [--status <status>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--archetype <archetype>` | Only items of this archetype: EPIC, TICKET, FEATURE, TASK or CAMPAIGN. |
| `--entity <entity>` | The work entity: its id or its qualified id (qits-100), passed to the service as it is. |
| `--outcome <outcome>` | Only DROPPED items dropped with this outcome: DUPLICATE, RESOLVED_ELSEWHERE, SUPERSEDED, OBSOLETE, INVALID or WONT_DO. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--parent <entity>` | Only the children of this item: its id or its qualified id. |
| `--project <project>` | The project (required): its id or its slug. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |
| `--status <status>` | Only items in this status, such as REFINED. |

### Examples

```
qits work list --project qits
qits work list --project qits --archetype epic --status REFINED
qits work list --project qits --parent qits-120 -o json
qits work list --project qits --status DROPPED --outcome duplicate
```

- --archetype, --status and --outcome are case-insensitive. --parent lists the children of one item.

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (for example an unknown archetype or status, HTTP 400, or a project it does not know, HTTP 404), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example no --project), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits work details

One work item: its fields, its description, its comment thread, its children, and what it closes: the items naming it as their supersededBy (dropped as its duplicate, resolved by it, or superseded by it). A DROPPED item shows its outcome beside the status, and its supersededBy as duplicate of, resolved by or superseded by.

```
qits work details [--entity <entity>] [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--entity <entity>` | The work entity: its id or its qualified id (qits-100), passed to the service as it is. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |

### Examples

```
qits work --entity qits-100 details
qits work details --entity 45a14f8e-f550-45bb-a117-6b34d8c472e3 -o json
```

- -o json prints one object: the item as the service answers it, its comments, its children and supersedes, the items it closes. Control characters are written as escapes.

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (for example an item it does not know, HTTP 404), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example no --entity), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits work create

File a new work item of an archetype.

Reads the payload, a JSON object, on stdin, sets its "archetype" from --archetype, and sends it to POST /projects/api/work. A root item names its "project" (id or slug), a child its "parent" (qualified id or id). The item starts REPORTED if its archetype has a lifecycle. The command prints the new item, its qualified id first.

With nothing on stdin (a terminal, or empty) it sends nothing, prints this usage and the payload's JSON schema, served by the service at GET /projects/api/work/archetypes/{archetype}/schemas/create, and exits with 0.

```
qits work create [--archetype <archetype>] [--entity <entity>] [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--archetype <archetype>` | The new item's archetype (required): EPIC, TICKET, FEATURE, TASK or CAMPAIGN. Case-insensitive. |
| `--entity <entity>` | The work entity: its id or its qualified id (qits-100), passed to the service as it is. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |

### Examples

```
qits work create --archetype ticket </dev/null
echo '{"project":"qits","title":"The log view stops at 64 KiB","ticketType":"BUG","impetus":"A long run's log is cut."}' | qits work create --archetype ticket
jq -n --rawfile d plan.md '{parent:"qits-120",title:"Retry",description:$d}' | qits work create --archetype feature -o json
```

- The first one prints the schema: nothing is sent.

### Exit codes

- `0` The item is filed, or nothing was put in and the schema is printed.
- `1` The platform refused (for example a payload it does not take, HTTP 400, your roles or another project, HTTP 403, or an archetype it does not know, HTTP 404), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example no --archetype, or a payload that is not a JSON object), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits work update

Edit a work item's fields.

Reads a JSON merge patch on stdin and sends it unchanged to PATCH /projects/api/work/{entity} as application/merge-patch+json: a property left out stays as it is, null clears it. Status and archetype are not edited here; see status and transition.

With nothing on stdin (a terminal, or empty) it sends nothing, looks the item up for its archetype, prints this usage and the patch's JSON schema for that archetype, served by the service at GET /projects/api/work/archetypes/{archetype}/schemas/update, and exits with 0.

```
qits work update [--entity <entity>] [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--entity <entity>` | The work entity: its id or its qualified id (qits-100), passed to the service as it is. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |

### Examples

```
qits work --entity qits-100 update </dev/null
echo '{"title":"The log view stops at 64 KiB"}' | qits work --entity qits-100 update
echo '{"assignee":null}' | qits work update --entity qits-100 -o json
```

### Exit codes

- `0` The item is edited, or nothing was put in and the schema is printed.
- `1` The platform refused (for example a patch it does not take, HTTP 400, your roles or another project, HTTP 403, or an item it does not know, HTTP 404), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example no --entity, or a patch that is not a JSON object), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits work transition

Reshape a work item into another archetype (a ticket into an epic, a feature into a task, ...), keeping its id, its number and its thread.

The door is full-state: what the request leaves out is cleared. So the command starts from the item as it stands (title, description, status, outcome, ticketType, impetus, assignee, supersededBy, repositoryId, implementingAt, implementedAt, dependsOn, and membership {parent, position} if it has a parent), merges the JSON object on stdin over it as a merge patch (null clears), sets "archetype", and drops every property the target archetype's schema has no slot for, naming them on stderr. It sends the result to POST /projects/api/work/transition, keyed by --entity as it was given.

With nothing on stdin (a terminal, or empty) it sends nothing, prints this usage and the target's JSON schema, served at GET /projects/api/work/archetypes/{archetype}/schemas/transition, names the required properties the item does not carry yet and the ones that would be dropped, and exits with 0.

With --map it restates several items at once: the payload is the whole request, {"<entity>": <full state>, ...}, sent unchanged. Each key is a qualified id or an id, and each state names its "archetype" and every property the item is to keep, because a property left out is cleared. The service judges the map as one post-state and writes all of it or nothing, so a move with no legal order (a feature becomes an epic while its tasks become features under it) is one call. Nothing is created or deleted: every id must already exist. A status change to or from READY_FOR_DEV, or into started work or REFINED, is refused here; use status. --map takes no --entity and no --archetype.

```
qits work transition [--archetype <archetype>] [--entity <entity>] [--map] [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--archetype <archetype>` | The archetype to turn the item into (required without --map): EPIC, TICKET, FEATURE, TASK or CAMPAIGN. Case-insensitive. |
| `--entity <entity>` | The work entity: its id or its qualified id (qits-100), passed to the service as it is. |
| `--map` | Send the payload as it is: a map of entity to full state, for several items at once. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |

### Examples

```
qits work --entity qits-100 transition --archetype epic </dev/null
echo '{}' | qits work --entity qits-100 transition --archetype epic
echo '{"membership":{"parent":"qits-120"}}' | qits work --entity qits-100 transition --archetype feature
jq -n '{"qits-101":{archetype:"EPIC",title:"Export",status:"REPORTED"},"qits-102":{archetype:"FEATURE",title:"CSV",status:"REPORTED",membership:{parent:"qits-101"}}}' | qits work transition --map
```

- {} carries the item over as it stands. membership.parent, supersededBy and dependsOn take a qualified id or an id.
- --map with nothing on stdin prints the request's schema from the service's OpenAPI document.

### Exit codes

- `0` The items are reshaped, or nothing was put in and the schema is printed.
- `1` The platform refused (for example a state it does not take, HTTP 400, your roles or another project, HTTP 403, an item or archetype it does not know, HTTP 404, or a conflict, HTTP 409), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example no --entity or --archetype, --map with either, or a payload that is not a JSON object), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits work status

Move a work item along its lifecycle: REPORTED, REFINED, READY_FOR_DEV, IMPLEMENTING, IMPLEMENTED, VERIFYING, VERIFIED, DONE, or DROPPED. Every archetype walks it, features and tasks included; campaigns keep a shorter walk and never enter IMPLEMENTING or VERIFYING. A SKIP transition lets READY_FOR_DEV move straight to IMPLEMENTED, bypassing IMPLEMENTING, and IMPLEMENTED move straight to VERIFIED, bypassing VERIFYING. IMPLEMENTING only moves forward or drops; it never moves back. REFINED to READY_FOR_DEV needs a person - a person's own `qits` CLI sign-in, or the browser; an agent credential is refused.

Reads {"target":"<STATUS>"} on stdin and sends it unchanged to POST /projects/api/work/{entity}/status. The service refuses a move its lifecycle does not allow (HTTP 409).

A move into DROPPED says why in "outcome": DUPLICATE (another item asks for the same thing), RESOLVED_ELSEWHERE (another item's change already resolved it), SUPERSEDED (a successor replaced it), OBSOLETE (the subject went away by itself), INVALID (it never was a problem) or WONT_DO (a decision was taken not to do it; scratch and probe items too). The first three name that other item in "supersededBy" (qualified id or id); the last three take none; any other move takes neither. Each breach is HTTP 400. Do not drop an item merely because it is hard or stale: block it instead. DROPPED moves back only to REPORTED, which clears both.

With nothing on stdin (a terminal, or empty) it sends nothing, prints this usage and the payload's schema, whose target enum is the moves open from the item's current status as the service's archetype registry (GET /projects/api/work/archetypes) states them, and exits with 0.

```
qits work status [--entity <entity>] [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--entity <entity>` | The work entity: its id or its qualified id (qits-100), passed to the service as it is. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |

### Examples

```
qits work --entity qits-100 status </dev/null
echo '{"target":"REFINED"}' | qits work --entity qits-100 status
echo '{"target":"DROPPED","outcome":"DUPLICATE","supersededBy":"qits-90"}' | qits work --entity qits-100 status
echo '{"target":"DROPPED","outcome":"OBSOLETE"}' | qits work --entity qits-100 status
```

- An epic's status move takes qits:admin; an agent is answered HTTP 403.
- REFINED to READY_FOR_DEV takes a person signed in with their own `qits` CLI or the browser; an agent credential is refused (HTTP 409, or HTTP 403 for an epic).

### Exit codes

- `0` The item moved, or nothing was put in and the legal targets are printed.
- `1` The platform refused (for example a drop without its outcome or reference, HTTP 400, a move the lifecycle does not allow, HTTP 409, your roles or another project, HTTP 403, or an item it does not know, HTTP 404), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example no --entity, an item on a service whose registry has not yet given its archetype a lifecycle, or a payload that is not a JSON object), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits work block

Block a ticket, an epic or a campaign: say that the phase its status started cannot go on, and why. Use it when you stop and cannot take the work further.

Sends {"blocked":true,"reason":"..."} to POST /projects/api/work/{entity}/blocked. The status does not move: it is the phase to resume, and the next status move clears the block. The reason lands on the item's comment thread, so write what is in the way concretely enough for somebody else to act on it.

```
qits work block [--entity <entity>] [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>] [--reason <text>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--entity <entity>` | The work entity: its id or its qualified id (qits-100), passed to the service as it is. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |
| `--reason <text>` | What is in the way (required). It lands on the item's thread. |

### Examples

```
qits work --entity qits-100 block --reason 'The database team must confirm the new limit.'
```

- A feature or a task runs no phase of its own: block its epic. An item that is VERIFIED, DONE or DROPPED cannot be blocked (HTTP 409).

### Exit codes

- `0` The item is blocked.
- `1` The platform refused (for example a feature, a task or a status that starts no phase, HTTP 409, your roles or another project, HTTP 403, or an item it does not know, HTTP 404), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example no --entity or no --reason), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits work unblock

Unblock a ticket, an epic or a campaign: say that what was in the way is gone and its phase can go on. Do it as soon as you know, whoever blocked it.

Sends {"blocked":false} to POST /projects/api/work/{entity}/blocked, with the reason when one is given. No status moves. A blocked campaign starts no new member until it is unblocked.

```
qits work unblock [--entity <entity>] [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>] [--reason <text>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--entity <entity>` | The work entity: its id or its qualified id (qits-100), passed to the service as it is. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |
| `--reason <text>` | Why it can go on again. Optional. |

### Examples

```
qits work --entity qits-100 unblock
qits work --entity qits-100 unblock --reason 'The limit is confirmed.' -o json
```

### Exit codes

- `0` The item is unblocked.
- `1` The platform refused (for example your roles or another project, HTTP 403, or an item it does not know, HTTP 404), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example no --entity), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits work delete

Delete a work item, its children and their comment threads. The audit log keeps them.

Sends DELETE /projects/api/work/{entity}. An agent may delete a feature or a task of its own project while the epic is REPORTED; deleting an epic or a ticket takes qits:admin. A campaign is never deleted: move its status to DROPPED.

```
qits work delete [--entity <entity>] [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--entity <entity>` | The work entity: its id or its qualified id (qits-100), passed to the service as it is. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |

### Examples

```
qits work --entity qits-104 delete
```

### Exit codes

- `0` The item is gone.
- `1` The platform refused (for example an epic or a ticket for an agent, or another project, HTTP 403, an item it does not know, HTTP 404, or a campaign or an epic past REPORTED, HTTP 409), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example no --entity), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits work progress

How a campaign is doing: each member in order with its state (DROPPED, DONE, DISPATCH_FAILED, JOINED_RUNNING, RUNNING, REFUSED, READY or WAITING) and the items it waits for.

Reads GET /projects/api/work/{entity}/progress, worked out fresh on every call. -o json adds each criterion of each member's condition, judged: whether it holds, the evidence, and what would make it hold. It also says whether the criteria evaluator is listening (evaluator: connected, stalled, consumerFailing with lastError), which tells a campaign that waits correctly from one that nothing listens for.

```
qits work progress [--entity <entity>] [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--entity <entity>` | The work entity: its id or its qualified id (qits-100), passed to the service as it is. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |

### Examples

```
qits work --entity qits-130 progress
qits work --entity qits-130 progress -o json
```

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (for example an item that is not a campaign, HTTP 404), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example no --entity), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits work dispatch

Put an agent on an epic or a ticket, or start a campaign: the Dispatch and Run the next phase buttons of the item's page.

--mode FLOW runs the phase the item's status starts and every phase after it, until a status starts none. --mode PHASE runs that one phase, then stops. A machine at REFINED waits for a person to move it to READY_FOR_DEV, unless the project's delivery desk may start refined items (qits projects delivery shows whether it may).

Sends {"mode":"FLOW"} or {"mode":"PHASE"}, with "rule" when --rule is given, to POST /projects/api/work/{entity}/dispatch, and prints the item, the mode, the phase started, the agent's branch and the assignee. A campaign answers its progress instead; qits work progress shows it.

```
qits work dispatch [--entity <entity>] [--mode <mode>] [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>] [--rule <rule>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--entity <entity>` | The work entity: its id or its qualified id (qits-100), passed to the service as it is. |
| `--mode <mode>` | FLOW (every phase from here on) or PHASE (the next one only); required. Case-insensitive. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |
| `--rule <rule>` | The delivery desk's rule the press is made under (backlog-newest-first, start-refined). Optional; the service ignores it for anyone but the desk. |

### Examples

```
qits work --entity qits-100 dispatch --mode flow
qits work dispatch --entity qits-100 --mode PHASE -o json
qits work --entity qits-100 dispatch --mode FLOW --rule backlog-newest-first
```

- Pressing takes qits:admin, or the project's delivery desk, which names the rule it presses under; a plain agent is answered HTTP 403.
- The service refuses a status that starts no phase, a feature or a task, a blocked item or a project with no wrapper (HTTP 409), and the command prints its sentence as it came.

### Exit codes

- `0` The agent is dispatched, or the campaign started.
- `1` The platform refused (for example a mode it does not know, HTTP 400, your roles, HTTP 403, an item it does not know, HTTP 404, or an item no phase can start from, HTTP 409), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example no --entity, or a --mode that is neither FLOW nor PHASE), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits work comment

The comment thread of a work entity: create adds a comment, update edits one.

Both read a JSON document on stdin and send it as it is. With nothing on stdin they send nothing and print the payload's JSON schema, with its required fields named.

### Notes

- The author is the signed-in caller (an agent's comment is its agent's), and an edit leaves it as it is. Only a comment's author may edit it (HTTP 403 otherwise).
- Deleting a comment takes qits:admin, and qits has no command for it.

## qits work comment create

Add a comment to a work entity's thread.

Reads the payload, a JSON object such as {"body":"..."}, on stdin and sends it unchanged to POST /projects/api/work/{entity}/comments. The body is Markdown. You are its author. The command prints the comment once filed.

With nothing on stdin (a terminal, or empty) it sends nothing, prints the payload's JSON schema from the service's OpenAPI document (/projects/q/openapi) with the required fields named, and exits with 0.

```
qits work comment create [--entity <entity>] [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--entity <entity>` | The work entity: its id or its qualified id (qits-100), passed to the service as it is. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |

### Examples

```
echo '{"body":"I can reproduce it."}' | qits work --entity qits-100 comment create
jq -n --rawfile b note.md '{body: $b}' | qits work comment create --entity qits-100 -o json
qits work --entity qits-100 comment create </dev/null
```

- The last one prints the schema: nothing is sent.
- -o json prints the service's answer; the table prints the comment's id, author and time.

### Exit codes

- `0` The comment is filed, or nothing was put in and the schema is printed.
- `1` The platform refused (for example your roles or another project's entity, HTTP 403, an entity it does not know, HTTP 404, or a payload it does not take, HTTP 400), cannot be reached, or its OpenAPI document does not describe the payload.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example a payload that is not a JSON object, or no --entity), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits work comment update

Edit a comment on a work entity's thread.

Reads a JSON merge patch, such as {"body":"..."}, on stdin and sends it unchanged to PATCH /projects/api/work/{entity}/comments/{commentId} as application/merge-patch+json. The path names the entity and the comment together, so the service answers a comment that is not on the entity's thread with HTTP 404. The author stays who it was. Only the comment's author may edit it; anybody else gets HTTP 403.

With nothing on stdin (a terminal, or empty) it sends nothing, prints the patch's JSON schema from the service's OpenAPI document (/projects/q/openapi) with the required fields named, and exits with 0.

```
qits work comment update [--comment <comment>] [--entity <entity>] [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--comment <comment>` | The comment to edit (required unless nothing is put in): its id. |
| `--entity <entity>` | The work entity: its id or its qualified id (qits-100), passed to the service as it is. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |

### Examples

```
echo '{"body":"Fixed in 2026.929.1."}' | qits work --entity qits-100 comment update --comment 8de195f1-631d-420a-893e-7baca2229be4
qits work --entity qits-100 comment update </dev/null
```

- --comment is the comment's full id, as `create` printed it.
- -o json prints the service's answer; the table prints the comment's id, author and time.

### Exit codes

- `0` The comment is edited, or nothing was put in and the schema is printed.
- `1` The platform refused (for example your roles, HTTP 403, an entity it does not know or a comment that is not on its thread, HTTP 404, or a patch it does not take, HTTP 400), cannot be reached, or its OpenAPI document does not describe the patch.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example a patch that is not a JSON object, or no --entity or --comment), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits work dossier

The dossier of an epic or a ticket: Markdown pages in reading order, for what the item's own description cannot hold. list shows the pages, get reads one, put adds or rewrites one, move reorders, delete removes one, and inline puts a sketch or a design into an epic's dossier.

The item's description is the short form: an epic's is the pitch, a ticket's is what refinement concluded. The dossier is what the implementer builds from, a page per part: what changes and how it works, with paths, names, exact values, examples and figures.

### Notes

- --page is a page's slug (as list shows it) or its id.
- Nobody accepts a write: a page is live the moment it lands. An epic's dossier is writable while the epic is REPORTED; a ticket's at every status.
- Reading and writing take qits:admin or qits:agent; an agent writes only in its own project.

## qits work dossier list

List the pages of an epic's or a ticket's dossier in reading order: position, slug, title, version and when it last changed. Read this before you add a page, so the new page does not repeat one that is there.

Reads GET /projects/api/work/{entity}/dossier. -o json includes each page's Markdown body.

```
qits work dossier list [--entity <entity>] [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--entity <entity>` | The work entity: its id or its qualified id (qits-100), passed to the service as it is. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |

### Examples

```
qits work --entity qits-100 dossier list
qits work dossier list --entity qits-100 -o json
```

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (for example an item it does not know or one with no dossier, HTTP 404), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example no --entity), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits work dossier get

Read one dossier page in full: its title, its Markdown body and its version.

Reads GET /projects/api/work/{entity}/dossier/{page}. Read a page before you rewrite it: put needs the version this answers, and a page is somebody's prose.

```
qits work dossier get [--entity <entity>] [--output table|json] [--page <page>] [--projects-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--entity <entity>` | The work entity: its id or its qualified id (qits-100), passed to the service as it is. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--page <page>` | The page (required): its slug or its id. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |

### Examples

```
qits work --entity qits-100 dossier get --page data-flow
qits work dossier get --entity qits-100 --page data-flow -o json
```

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (for example no such item or no such page, HTTP 404), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example no --entity or no --page), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits work dossier put

Add a page to an epic's or a ticket's dossier, or rewrite one.

Without --page it adds a page at the end: the payload is {"title":"...","body":"..."}, sent to POST /projects/api/work/{entity}/dossier. The slug is made from the title and never changes.

With --page it rewrites that page: the payload is {"title"?:"...","body"?:"...","version":<n>}, sent to PUT /projects/api/work/{entity}/dossier/{page}. A property left out keeps its value. version is the one get gave you; when somebody wrote to the page after you read it, the service refuses (HTTP 409). Read the page again, fold your change into it and write again; never write without a version.

The body is Markdown. Write what changes and how it works: paths, names, commands, exact values. To show a sketch or a design on an epic's page, get its Markdown line from inline; never write a figure URL by hand. A ticket's dossier has no figures.

With nothing on stdin (a terminal, or empty) it sends nothing, prints the payload's JSON schema from the service's OpenAPI document (/projects/q/openapi) and exits with 0.

```
qits work dossier put [--entity <entity>] [--output table|json] [--page <page>] [--projects-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--entity <entity>` | The work entity: its id or its qualified id (qits-100), passed to the service as it is. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--page <page>` | The page to rewrite: its slug or its id. Leave it out to add a page. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |

### Examples

```
jq -n --rawfile b plan.md '{title:"Data flow", body:$b}' | qits work --entity qits-100 dossier put
jq -n --rawfile b plan.md '{body:$b, version:3}' | qits work --entity qits-100 dossier put --page data-flow
qits work --entity qits-100 dossier put --page data-flow </dev/null
```

### Exit codes

- `0` The page is written, or nothing was put in and the schema is printed.
- `1` The platform refused (for example a blank title or no version, HTTP 400, another project, HTTP 403, no such item or page, HTTP 404, or a stale version or an epic past REPORTED, HTTP 409), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example no --entity, or a payload that is not a JSON object), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits work dossier move

Move a dossier page to a position in the reading order, counted from 0. The pages between its old and new place shift to close the gap.

Sends {"position":<n>} to POST /projects/api/work/{entity}/dossier/{page}/move. Reading order is the only structure a dossier has: there is no nesting, and a page's own headings are its second level.

```
qits work dossier move [--entity <entity>] [--output table|json] [--page <page>] [--position <n>] [--projects-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--entity <entity>` | The work entity: its id or its qualified id (qits-100), passed to the service as it is. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--page <page>` | The page to move (required): its slug or its id. |
| `--position <n>` | Where it goes (required), counted from 0. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |

### Examples

```
qits work --entity qits-100 dossier move --page data-flow --position 0
```

### Exit codes

- `0` The page is moved.
- `1` The platform refused (for example another project, HTTP 403, no such item or page, HTTP 404, or an epic past REPORTED, HTTP 409), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example no --entity, --page or --position), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits work dossier delete

Delete a dossier page. The pages after it close the gap.

Sends DELETE /projects/api/work/{entity}/dossier/{page}. Deleting somebody's page is not a way to disagree with it: rewrite the part that is wrong, and delete only what you added and no longer mean. On an epic, a figure no other page shows goes with it.

```
qits work dossier delete [--entity <entity>] [--output table|json] [--page <page>] [--projects-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--entity <entity>` | The work entity: its id or its qualified id (qits-100), passed to the service as it is. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--page <page>` | The page to delete (required): its slug or its id. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |

### Examples

```
qits work --entity qits-100 dossier delete --page old-notes
```

### Exit codes

- `0` The page is gone.
- `1` The platform refused (for example another project, HTTP 403, no such item or page, HTTP 404, or an epic past REPORTED, HTTP 409), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example no --entity or no --page), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits work dossier inline

Copy a sketch or a design of an epic's refinement into the epic's dossier, and print the exact Markdown line to paste into a page.

Sends {"sourceId":"...","kind":"IMAGE|DESIGN"} to POST /projects/api/work/{entity}/dossier-assets. IMAGE is a sketch from the refinement's Sketch tab, DESIGN a design (`qits work design list`). The line renders as a picture or as a framed document. The copy keeps rendering after the refinement is gone, and inlining the same figure again gives the same line, not a second copy.

Never write a figure URL by hand: it ends up naming something that does not exist or belongs to another epic, and the page shows it broken.

```
qits work dossier inline [--entity <entity>] [--kind <kind>] [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>] [--source <id>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--entity <entity>` | The work entity: its id or its qualified id (qits-100), passed to the service as it is. |
| `--kind <kind>` | IMAGE for a sketch, DESIGN for a design (required). Case-insensitive. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |
| `--source <id>` | The sketch's or the design's id (required). |

### Examples

```
qits work --entity qits-100 dossier inline --source 6f1c0e2a-... --kind design
```

- The table prints the Markdown line alone; -o json prints the figure's id, kind, label and URL too.

### Exit codes

- `0` The figure is in the dossier and its line is printed.
- `1` The platform refused (for example another project, HTTP 403, or an item that is not an epic or no such figure in its refinement, HTTP 404), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example no --entity, --source or --kind), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits work members

The members of a campaign: the epics and tickets it runs, in order, each with the condition it waits on. list shows them, add gathers one, move reorders, remove takes one out, and condition replaces what one waits on. `qits work progress` shows how they are doing.

A condition is groups OR'd of criteria AND'd: a member waits until every criterion of at least one group holds.

### Notes

- --entity is the campaign. --member is a membership's id, as list prints it, not the member item's id.
- Members and conditions change only while the campaign is REPORTED, REFINED or READY_FOR_DEV.
- Starting a campaign and approving an APPROVAL criterion are a person's to do.

## qits work members list

List a campaign's members in order: membership id, position, the member's qualified id, archetype, status and title, and whether it waits on a condition.

Reads GET /projects/api/work/{entity}/members. -o json adds each member's condition (groups of criteria with their latches) and its dispatch record.

```
qits work members list [--entity <entity>] [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--entity <entity>` | The work entity: its id or its qualified id (qits-100), passed to the service as it is. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |

### Examples

```
qits work --entity qits-130 members list
qits work --entity qits-130 members list -o json
```

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (for example no campaign with this id, HTTP 404), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example no --entity), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits work members add

Gather an epic or a ticket into a campaign.

Reads {"entityId":"<qualified id or id>","position"?:<n>,"inFlight"?:true|false} on stdin and sends it unchanged to POST /projects/api/work/{entity}/members. Without position it goes at the end. When the member before it is not yet VERIFIED or DONE, the new member is made to wait for that one to reach VERIFIED, so the order states the dependency; change it with `members condition`. Without inFlight the service decides: a member already IMPLEMENTING or later, or with an ACTIVE workspace on its branch, joins running.

With nothing on stdin (a terminal, or empty) it sends nothing, prints the payload's JSON schema from the service's OpenAPI document (/projects/q/openapi) and exits with 0.

```
qits work members add [--entity <entity>] [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--entity <entity>` | The work entity: its id or its qualified id (qits-100), passed to the service as it is. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |

### Examples

```
echo '{"entityId":"qits-101"}' | qits work --entity qits-130 members add
echo '{"entityId":"qits-102","position":0}' | qits work --entity qits-130 members add
qits work --entity qits-130 members add </dev/null
```

### Exit codes

- `0` The member is added, or nothing was put in and the schema is printed.
- `1` The platform refused (for example no entityId, HTTP 400, another project, HTTP 403, no such campaign or item, HTTP 404, or one that cannot join - a member already, a feature or a task, a closed campaign - HTTP 409), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example no --entity, or a payload that is not a JSON object), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits work members move

Move a member to a position in the campaign, counted from 0; past the end is the last place. The members between shift.

Sends {"position":<n>} to PUT /projects/api/work/{entity}/members/{membershipId}/position and prints the members in their new order. It changes no condition: what a member waits on is its criteria, not its place.

```
qits work members move [--entity <entity>] [--member <membership>] [--output table|json] [--position <n>] [--projects-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--entity <entity>` | The work entity: its id or its qualified id (qits-100), passed to the service as it is. |
| `--member <membership>` | The membership to move (required): its id, as list prints it. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--position <n>` | Where it goes (required), counted from 0. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |

### Examples

```
qits work --entity qits-130 members move --member 5f2c0a9e-... --position 0
```

### Exit codes

- `0` The member is moved.
- `1` The platform refused (for example another project, HTTP 403, or no such campaign or membership, HTTP 404), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example no --entity, --member or --position), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits work members remove

Take a member out of a campaign, with its condition.

Sends DELETE /projects/api/work/{entity}/members/{membershipId} and prints the members that remain. Refused once the member is claimed (its run record would be lost), and while another member's condition still names it: change that condition first.

```
qits work members remove [--entity <entity>] [--member <membership>] [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--entity <entity>` | The work entity: its id or its qualified id (qits-100), passed to the service as it is. |
| `--member <membership>` | The membership to remove (required): its id, as list prints it. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |

### Examples

```
qits work --entity qits-130 members remove --member 5f2c0a9e-...
```

### Exit codes

- `0` The member is removed.
- `1` The platform refused (for example another project, HTTP 403, no such campaign or membership, HTTP 404, or a claimed member or one another member waits on, HTTP 409), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example no --entity or no --member), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits work members condition

Replace what a campaign member waits on, whole.

Reads {"groups":[{"criteria":[{"id"?,"kind","predicate"}]}]} on stdin and sends it unchanged to PUT /projects/api/work/{entity}/members/{membershipId}/condition. What you state is the whole condition afterwards; what you leave out is deleted. Groups are OR'd, criteria in a group AND'd. {"groups":[]} makes the member wait on nothing; an empty group is refused. Restate a criterion with its id to keep whether it already held; one without an id is new.

Kinds and their predicates: ENTITY_STATUS {entityId, status} - another member of this campaign (qualified id or id) reaches that status. DEPLOYMENT_ACTIVE {applicationName, environmentName?, minimumVersion?} - that application goes live. SCM_RELEASE {repositoryName, projectId?, minimumVersion?} - that repository releases. APPROVAL {} - a person says yes.

With nothing on stdin (a terminal, or empty) it sends nothing, prints the payload's JSON schema from the service's OpenAPI document (/projects/q/openapi) and exits with 0.

```
qits work members condition [--entity <entity>] [--member <membership>] [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--entity <entity>` | The work entity: its id or its qualified id (qits-100), passed to the service as it is. |
| `--member <membership>` | The membership whose condition to replace (required unless nothing is put in): its id, as list prints it. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |

### Examples

```
echo '{"groups":[{"criteria":[{"kind":"ENTITY_STATUS","predicate":{"entityId":"qits-101","status":"VERIFIED"}}]}]}' | qits work --entity qits-130 members condition --member 5f2c0a9e-...
echo '{"groups":[]}' | qits work --entity qits-130 members condition --member 5f2c0a9e-...
```

- Refused once the member is claimed: its condition is settled.

### Exit codes

- `0` The condition is replaced, or nothing was put in and the schema is printed.
- `1` The platform refused (for example a criterion it cannot read, HTTP 400, another project, HTTP 403, no such campaign or membership, HTTP 404, or a claimed member, HTTP 409), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example no --entity or no --member, or a payload that is not a JSON object), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits work refinement

An epic's or a ticket's refinement room: the workspace with its own container and its own refining/<slug> branch where the item's scope is worked out, and where its designs live. open opens the room and brings its container up, show shows it, discard tears it down.

An item has at most one room, opened only while the item is at REPORTED and never for a feature or a task. The move from REPORTED to REFINED is the gate on the plan; the room stays until it is discarded or the item reaches a final status.

### Notes

- --entity is the epic or the ticket, not the room. The room's own id is in show's ID column.
- show takes qits:admin, qits:admin-agent or qits:agent. open and discard take qits:admin or qits:admin-agent; an agent with qits:agent alone is refused (HTTP 403).

## qits work refinement open

Open an epic's or a ticket's refinement room and bring its container up, as the Refine button does. An item that already has a room gets that room back, and its container is brought up again: a stopped one is woken, a running one is left running.

Sends POST /projects/api/work/{entity}/refinement, then POST /projects/api/refinements/{id}/ensure-container with the room's id. The container comes up in the background; the technical process it prints narrates that. Shows the room's id, its item, its label and its status, which is PROVISIONING while the container comes up.

```
qits work refinement open [--entity <entity>] [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--entity <entity>` | The work entity: its id or its qualified id (qits-100), passed to the service as it is. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |

### Examples

```
qits work --entity qits-100 refinement open
qits work --entity qits-100 refinement open -o json
```

### Exit codes

- `0` The room is open and its container is coming up.
- `1` The platform refused (for example your roles, HTTP 403, an item it does not know, HTTP 404, an item that cannot be refined now, such as one not at REPORTED, a feature or a task, HTTP 409, or a branch the git host would not cut, HTTP 502), or the platform cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example no --entity), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits work refinement show

Show an epic's or a ticket's refinement room: its id, its item, its label and its status, such as PROVISIONING, RUNNING or STOPPED. An item with no room says so and exits with 0.

Reads GET /projects/api/work/{entity}/refinement; it never opens a room.

```
qits work refinement show [--entity <entity>] [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--entity <entity>` | The work entity: its id or its qualified id (qits-100), passed to the service as it is. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |

### Examples

```
qits work --entity qits-100 refinement show
qits work --entity qits-100 refinement show -o json
```

### Exit codes

- `0` Done, also when the item has no room.
- `1` The platform refused (for example an item it does not know, HTTP 404), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example no --entity), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits work refinement discard

Discard an epic's or a ticket's refinement room. This deletes the room's container, its refining/<slug> branch, and its designs, prompt draft and prompt images with it; none of it can be brought back. The work item itself is untouched, and a later open starts a fresh room.

Reads GET /projects/api/work/{entity}/refinement for the room, then sends POST /projects/api/refinements/{id}/discard.

```
qits work refinement discard [--entity <entity>] [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--entity <entity>` | The work entity: its id or its qualified id (qits-100), passed to the service as it is. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |

### Examples

```
qits work --entity qits-100 refinement discard
qits work --entity qits-100 refinement discard -o json
```

### Exit codes

- `0` The room is discarded.
- `1` The platform refused (for example your roles, HTTP 403, or an item or room it does not know, HTTP 404), the item has no room, or the platform cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example no --entity), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits work design

The HTML designs of an epic's or a ticket's refinement: the documents a person sees in the Design tab. list shows them, get reads one with its document, put adds or rewrites one.

There is no draft: a design is live the moment it is written, and a person may rename or delete it. The gate on the plan is the item's move from REPORTED to REFINED.

### Notes

- --entity is the epic or the ticket, not the refinement. An item with no open refinement has no designs.
- Reading takes qits:admin or qits:agent. Writing takes qits:admin or qits:admin-agent; an agent with qits:agent alone is refused (HTTP 403).

## qits work design list

List the designs of an epic's or a ticket's refinement, oldest first, without their documents: id, title, version, size, whether a dossier page shows it, and when it changed.

Reads GET /projects/api/work/{entity}/refinement for the refinement, then GET /projects/api/refinements/{id}/designs. Read a design with get before you rewrite it.

```
qits work design list [--entity <entity>] [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--entity <entity>` | The work entity: its id or its qualified id (qits-100), passed to the service as it is. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |

### Examples

```
qits work --entity qits-100 design list
qits work --entity qits-100 design list -o json
```

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (for example an item it does not know, HTTP 404), the item has no open refinement, or the platform cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example no --entity), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits work design get

Read one design in full: its title, its version and the whole HTML document, styles inline and no scripts. Send the same shape back when you rewrite it, with this version.

Reads GET /projects/api/work/{entity}/refinement for the refinement, then GET /projects/api/refinements/{id}/designs/{designId}.

```
qits work design get [--design <design>] [--entity <entity>] [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--design <design>` | The design's id (required). |
| `--entity <entity>` | The work entity: its id or its qualified id (qits-100), passed to the service as it is. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |

### Examples

```
qits work --entity qits-100 design get --design 6f1c0e2a-...
qits work --entity qits-100 design get --design 6f1c0e2a-... -o json | jq -r .html
```

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (for example no such item or design, HTTP 404), the item has no open refinement, or the platform cannot be reached.

## qits work design put

Add a design to an epic's or a ticket's refinement, or rewrite one.

Without --design it adds one: the payload is {"title":"...","html":"..."}, sent to POST /projects/api/refinements/{id}/designs. With --design it rewrites that design in place: the payload is {"title":"...","html"?:"...","version":<n>}, sent to PUT /projects/api/refinements/{id}/designs/{designId}; the title is required, and leaving html out only renames it.

html is a COMPLETE HTML document with inline styles and no scripts, the shape get answers. version is the one get gave you. When somebody wrote to the design after you read it, the service refuses (HTTP 409): read it again, fold your change in and write again; never write without a version.

The refinement comes from GET /projects/api/work/{entity}/refinement. With nothing on stdin (a terminal, or empty) it sends nothing, prints the payload's JSON schema from the service's OpenAPI document (/projects/q/openapi) and exits with 0.

```
qits work design put [--design <design>] [--entity <entity>] [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--design <design>` | The design to rewrite: its id. Leave it out to add a design. |
| `--entity <entity>` | The work entity: its id or its qualified id (qits-100), passed to the service as it is. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |

### Examples

```
jq -n --rawfile h board.html '{title:"Board", html:$h}' | qits work --entity qits-100 design put
jq -n --rawfile h board.html '{title:"Board", html:$h, version:2}' | qits work --entity qits-100 design put --design 6f1c0e2a-...
qits work --entity qits-100 design put </dev/null
```

### Exit codes

- `0` The design is written, or nothing was put in and the schema is printed.
- `1` The platform refused (for example no title, html or version, HTTP 400, your roles, HTTP 403, no such item or design, HTTP 404, or a stale version, HTTP 409), the item has no open refinement, or the platform cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example no --entity, or a payload that is not a JSON object), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits release-request

Release requests: the one way to release a repository. list shows them (of the whole project, or of one repository), create asks for a branch to be released, join adds a branch to an open request, withdraw ends a request that must not ship, approve lets the fold a request is on go ahead, decline sends it back, and regenerate runs one release output again.

A request folds main and its branches into one commit, and the builds of that commit are its gate. States: PENDING (waiting for its builds), READY, RELEASED (the tag is cut, waiting on its remaining gates), FINALIZED (the tag is merged into main, done), REJECTED (a gating build was red), FAILED (the release itself failed), CONFLICTED (the branches do not merge), WITHDRAWN, OBSOLETE (a later request for the repository superseded this one before it finished).

create, join, withdraw, approve and decline print the request's quality gates as the platform sends them: one row per gate (kind, position, state, detail), and, under a gate that is waiting on something specific, one indented line per check it is waiting for (such as the upstream request an upstream-in-flight gate names). An older platform with no qualityGates[] yet gets the deprecated gates table instead (kind, state, reason).

### Notes

- A REJECTED or CONFLICTED request comes back by itself when one of its branches gets a new push. Fix the branch and push; do not open a new request.
- When a red build was the platform's fault and not the code's (a flaked container, a registry that was down), retry that run with `qits ci retry <run id>`: it builds the same commit again. `qits ci runs --release-request <id>` finds the request's runs. Do not open a new request, and do not withdraw this one.
- `withdraw` is only for a request that must not ship: the change is wrong, or nobody wants it any more. WITHDRAWN is final.
- approve and decline judge one fold: the request's merged sha. A push that folds the request again leaves the decision behind, and the new fold waits for a decision of its own.
- decline is not withdraw. A declined request goes REJECTED and comes back with the next push to one of its branches; WITHDRAWN is final.
- A release request carries a list of approval requirements, each naming the roles that may satisfy it: person, agent (an agent of the request's own project) or agent@<project slug>. approve and decline print them, with whether each is satisfied and by whom, before reading the request and again after deciding. A person holding qits:admin may satisfy a requirement admitting person; an agent may satisfy one admitting agent or agent@<its project>, including a requirement on the very request it asked for, unless that requirement excludes the request's own authors. Asserted identity headers, service clients and qits:system are refused (HTTP 403) either way.
- --project and --repository may come before or after the command. list, approve and decline work without --repository; approve and decline find the request in the project.

## qits release-request list

List release requests: of the whole project, or of one repository with --repository.

Without --repository it shows every repository's requests, as the landing app does: the open ones and the last 10 FINALIZED, most recently moved first, with a REPOSITORY and an APPROVAL column.

With --repository it shows that repository's open requests only. Open means every state but FINALIZED, WITHDRAWN and OBSOLETE.

--state asks for other ones in both forms. The ID column shows the request's id, <repository>-rr-<n>, which `join` and `withdraw` take. -o json also has its uuid (id); the commands take that too.

```
qits release-request list [--limit <n>] [--output table|json] [--project <project>] [--projects-url <url>] [--repository <repository>] [--state <STATE|all>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--limit <n>` | Show at most this many requests, the most recent first. Default: all that came back. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--project <project>` | The project: its id, slug or name. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |
| `--repository <repository>` | The repository: its id or name. |
| `--state <STATE\|all>` | Only this state (PENDING, READY, RELEASED, FINALIZED, REJECTED, FAILED, CONFLICTED, WITHDRAWN, OBSOLETE), or all for every request. Default: the open ones (and, for the whole project, the last 10 FINALIZED). |

### Examples

```
qits release-request --project qits list
qits release-request --project qits list --state all --limit 20
qits release-request --project qits --repository qits-ci-service list
qits release-request --project qits --repository qits-ci-service list --state all -o json
```

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits release-request create

Ask for a branch to be released once its builds are green.

The platform may answer with a new request, the open request that already holds the branch, or (on a project wrapper) the open request the branch joined. It prints what came back.

```
qits release-request create --branch <branch> --summary <text> [--output table|json] [--priority <priority>] [--project <project>] [--projects-url <url>] [--repository <repository>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--branch <branch>` | Required. The branch to release. |
| `--summary <text>` | Required. What the release is for, in a sentence. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--priority <priority>` | LOWEST, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, HIGHER or BLOCKING. Default: the platform's (MEDIUM). |
| `--project <project>` | The project: its id, slug or name. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |
| `--repository <repository>` | The repository: its id or name. |

### Examples

```
qits release-request --project qits --repository qits-ci-service create --branch feature/log-view --summary "Show the build log live"
qits release-request --project qits --repository qits-ci-service create --branch main --summary "Release main" --priority HIGH
```

- Asking again for a branch that is on an open request answers that request; it opens no second one. Check the id that comes back.
- On a project wrapper the answer can be a request somebody else opened. Its summary stands, and a red gate holds every branch on it.
- To add another branch to a request you have, use `join`.

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits release-request join

Add a branch to an open release request.

The platform folds the request again with the branch and, if that makes a new commit, builds that commit. It prints the request that came back.

```
qits release-request join --branch <branch> --request <id> [--output table|json] [--priority <priority>] [--project <project>] [--projects-url <url>] [--repository <repository>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--branch <branch>` | Required. The branch to add. |
| `--request <id>` | Required. The request: its id as list shows it (qits-ci-service-rr-12), its uuid, or the start of the uuid. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--priority <priority>` | LOWEST, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, HIGHER or BLOCKING. Default: MEDIUM for a new branch; a branch already on the request keeps its priority. |
| `--project <project>` | The project: its id, slug or name. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |
| `--repository <repository>` | The repository: its id or name. |

### Examples

```
qits release-request --project qits --repository qits-ci-service join --request qits-ci-service-rr-12 --branch feature/log-search
qits release-request --project qits --repository qits-ci-service join --request qits-ci-service-rr-12 --branch feature/log-search --priority BLOCKING
```

- Safe to repeat: a branch already on the request adds nothing. With --priority it states that priority again; without, the branch keeps its priority.
- A RELEASED, FINALIZED, WITHDRAWN or OBSOLETE request takes no more branches (HTTP 409): open a new one with `create`.

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example a --request that fits no request, or more than one), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits release-request withdraw

Withdraw an open release request, so it does not ship.

WITHDRAWN is final: the request is not built or released again, and its branches are free. The next `create` for one of them opens a new request. It prints the request that came back.

```
qits release-request withdraw --request <id> [--output table|json] [--project <project>] [--projects-url <url>] [--reason <text>] [--repository <repository>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--request <id>` | Required. The request: its id as list shows it (qits-ci-service-rr-12), its uuid, or the start of the uuid. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--project <project>` | The project: its id, slug or name. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |
| `--reason <text>` | Why it must not ship, in a sentence. The request shows it as its detail. Default: the platform writes who withdrew it. |
| `--repository <repository>` | The repository: its id or name. |

### Examples

```
qits release-request --project qits --repository qits-ci-service withdraw --request qits-ci-service-rr-12
qits release-request --project qits --repository qits-ci-service withdraw --request qits-ci-service-rr-12 --reason "The log view moves to qits-observability"
```

- Only for a request that must not ship. A gating build that was red because of the platform, not the code, runs again with `qits ci retry <run id>`. A REJECTED or CONFLICTED request comes back by itself when one of its branches gets a new push.
- Without --reason the platform writes who withdrew it.
- A RELEASED, FINALIZED, WITHDRAWN or OBSOLETE request cannot be withdrawn (HTTP 409).

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example a --request that fits no request, or more than one), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits release-request approve

Approve the fold a release request is on, so it may release once its gates are green.

The approval is for one fold, the request's merged sha. A push that folds the request again leaves it behind, and the new fold needs an approval of its own. It prints the request's approval requirements, with their admitted roles and whether each is satisfied, before the decision and again after, then the request that came back.

```
qits release-request approve --request <id> [--note <text>] [--output table|json] [--project <project>] [--projects-url <url>] [--repository <repository>] [--sha <merged sha>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--request <id>` | Required. The request: its id as list shows it (qits-ci-service-rr-221), in any case, or its whole uuid. It is found in the project, so --repository is not needed. |
| `--note <text>` | Why, in a sentence, for the record. A decline's note becomes the request's detail, the first thing whoever answers the decline reads. Default: none. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--project <project>` | The project: its id, slug or name. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |
| `--repository <repository>` | The repository: its id or name. |
| `--sha <merged sha>` | The fold you judged: the request's merged sha, as the landing app or -o json shows it. This is the strict form: the platform refuses the decision (HTTP 409) if the request is on another fold by then. Without it the command judges whatever fold the request is on at the moment it is read. |

### Examples

```
qits release-request --project qits approve --request qits-ci-service-rr-221 --sha 3f9c2e1a7b8d4c6e5f0a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e
qits release-request --project qits approve --request qits-ci-service-rr-221 --note "Read the diff: the pin moves to the export release."
```

- Give --sha to approve exactly the fold you read. Without it the command approves whatever fold the request is on when it reads it.
- A person holding qits:admin may satisfy a requirement that admits person. An agent may satisfy a requirement that admits agent or agent@<its project>, including one on the very request it asked for, unless that requirement excludes the request's own authors. Asserted identity headers, service clients and qits:system are refused (HTTP 403) either way; the message names each open requirement and the roles it admits.
- HTTP 409 means the request is on another fold than the one sent (the message names the one it is on now), has no fold, has concluded or is being released, or every requirement at the fold is already satisfied. Read it again and judge the fold it is on.

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status and says why), cannot be reached, or the request has no fold yet, so there is nothing to approve.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits release-request decline

Decline the fold a release request is on, so it does not release.

The request goes REJECTED and comes back by itself when one of its branches gets a new push, which makes a new fold to judge. It is not withdraw: WITHDRAWN is final. It prints the request's approval requirements, with their admitted roles and whether each is satisfied, before the decision and again after, then the request that came back.

```
qits release-request decline --request <id> [--note <text>] [--output table|json] [--project <project>] [--projects-url <url>] [--repository <repository>] [--sha <merged sha>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--request <id>` | Required. The request: its id as list shows it (qits-ci-service-rr-221), in any case, or its whole uuid. It is found in the project, so --repository is not needed. |
| `--note <text>` | Why, in a sentence, for the record. A decline's note becomes the request's detail, the first thing whoever answers the decline reads. Default: none. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--project <project>` | The project: its id, slug or name. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |
| `--repository <repository>` | The repository: its id or name. |
| `--sha <merged sha>` | The fold you judged: the request's merged sha, as the landing app or -o json shows it. This is the strict form: the platform refuses the decision (HTTP 409) if the request is on another fold by then. Without it the command judges whatever fold the request is on at the moment it is read. |

### Examples

```
qits release-request --project qits decline --request qits-ci-service-rr-221 --sha 3f9c2e1a7b8d4c6e5f0a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e --note "The README promises an approval policy nobody has signed off yet."
```

- Give --sha to decline exactly the fold you read. Without it the command declines whatever fold the request is on when it reads it.
- To stop a request for good, use `withdraw` instead.
- A person holding qits:admin may satisfy a requirement that admits person. An agent may satisfy a requirement that admits agent or agent@<its project>, including one on the very request it asked for, unless that requirement excludes the request's own authors. Asserted identity headers, service clients and qits:system are refused (HTTP 403) either way; the message names each requirement it concerns and the roles it admits.
- HTTP 409 means the request is on another fold than the one sent (the message names the one it is on now), has no fold, has concluded or is being released, or its fold has no approval requirement at all. Read it again and judge the fold it is on.

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status and says why), cannot be reached, or the request has no fold yet, so there is nothing to decline.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits release-request regenerate

Generate one release output again on an open release request: the entity diagram, the screenshot baselines, the dependency bump, the estate pins, or the golden recordings (maven or npm).

QA checks the entity diagram and the screenshot baselines and fails when they are stale; it does not regenerate them. This command asks for the run. The automation commits the output to maintenance/automations/<kind>/<request id>, the request folds again with it, and QA then runs again. It prints the run's id.

```
qits release-request regenerate --kind <kind> [--output table|json] [--project <project>] [--projects-url <url>] [--repository <repository>] [--request <id>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--kind <kind>` | Required. What to generate: entity-diagram, screenshot-baselines, dependency-bump, estate-pins, golden-recordings-maven or golden-recordings-npm. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--project <project>` | The project: its id, slug or name. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `projects` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://projects.qits.wohlben.eu). |
| `--repository <repository>` | The repository: its id or name. |
| `--request <id>` | The request: its id as list shows it (qits-ci-service-rr-12), its uuid, or the start of the uuid. Default: the repository's one open request. |

### Examples

```
qits release-request --project qits --repository qits-landing-app regenerate --kind screenshot-baselines
qits release-request --project qits --repository qits-projects-service regenerate --request qits-projects-service-rr-12 --kind entity-diagram
```

- Without --request it takes the repository's one open request. A REJECTED request is open: a red QA is the usual reason to regenerate.
- 409 means a run of this kind is already active for the request, the request is not open or has no fold, or bumping is off. 404 means the platform knows no such kind or request. 503 means qits-maintenance cannot be reached; nothing ran.
- `qits maintenance automations --request <id>` shows each kind's state, and `qits maintenance bump <run id>` how the run went.

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example no --request when the repository has no open request or more than one), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits ci

The builds of qits-ci: runs lists a repository's runs, run shows one run with its steps and their logs, retry runs a finished run again, and report shows a run's release reports (report submit is the CI step's side, which collects and uploads them).

A release request's gating runs build its backing branch release/<request id> and carry the request's id. Statuses: QUEUED and RUNNING (not finished), SUCCESS, FAILED (the code's verdict), and CANCELLED, TIMED_OUT, CONFIG_ERROR (the run's end, not a verdict on the code).

### Notes

- Reading runs needs the role qits:admin or qits:system. retry needs qits:admin.
- To follow a run, run `qits ci run <run id>` again. There is no live log stream. A build's verdict also comes as an event: `qits events --filter=BuildSuccessful,BuildFailed`.
- --project, --repository, --output and the two -url options may come before or after the command.
- A release request's QA run carries release reports: which tests failed, with their class, name and message, and the line coverage of the tree and of the change, with more kinds to come. `qits ci report show <run id>` lists them.

## qits ci runs

List a repository's CI runs, newest first.

Columns: the run's id (its first 8 characters, enough for `run` and `retry` with --project and --repository), status, branch, commit, the release request, when it was created, and how long it took (so far, while it runs).

```
qits ci runs [--branch <branch>] [--ci-url <url>] [--limit <n>] [--output table|json] [--project <project>] [--projects-url <url>] [--release-request <id>] [--repository <repository>] [--status <STATUS>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--branch <branch>` | Only the runs of this branch: main, release/<request id>, or a version for a release run. |
| `--ci-url <url>` | The ci service's base URL, without /ci. Default: QITS_CI_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `ci` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://ci.qits.wohlben.eu). |
| `--limit <n>` | At most this many runs, the newest. Default: 20. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed, with control characters written as escapes. |
| `--project <project>` | The project: its id, slug or name. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects, where --project and --repository are looked up. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else derived from the idp address like --ci-url. |
| `--release-request <id>` | Only the runs of this release request: its id (qits-ci-service-rr-12), its uuid, or the start of the uuid. |
| `--repository <repository>` | The repository: its id or name. |
| `--status <STATUS>` | Only the runs in this status: QUEUED, RUNNING, SUCCESS, FAILED, CANCELLED, TIMED_OUT or CONFIG_ERROR. |

### Examples

```
qits ci runs --project qits --repository qits-ci-service
qits ci runs --project qits --repository qits-ci-service --status FAILED --limit 5
qits ci runs --project qits --repository qits-ci-service --release-request qits-ci-service-rr-12
qits ci runs --project qits --repository qits-ci-service --branch main -o json
```

- A release request's gating runs: --release-request with the request's id as `qits release-request list` shows it (qits-ci-service-rr-12), its uuid or the start of the uuid. They build the request's branch, release/<request id>.
- The service filters by repository and count only. --branch, --status and --release-request are applied here, over all of the repository's runs, and --limit after them.

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits ci run

Show one CI run: what it built, its status, and its steps with their exit codes.

--logs also prints each step's output, the first step first. The service keeps the end of each step's output. A running step shows what it has printed so far. Terminal control characters are taken out.

```
qits ci run [--ci-url <url>] [--logs] [--output table|json] [--project <project>] [--projects-url <url>] [--repository <repository>] <run id>
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `<run id>` | The run: its id, or its start when --project and --repository name its repository. |
| `--ci-url <url>` | The ci service's base URL, without /ci. Default: QITS_CI_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `ci` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://ci.qits.wohlben.eu). |
| `--logs` | Also print each step's output, with terminal control characters taken out. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed, with control characters written as escapes. |
| `--project <project>` | The project: its id, slug or name. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects, where --project and --repository are looked up. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else derived from the idp address like --ci-url. |
| `--repository <repository>` | The repository: its id or name. |

### Examples

```
qits ci run 5f2c0a9e-1b7d-4c2e-9a41-3d8e6f0b2c17 --logs
qits ci run 5f2c0a9e --project qits --repository qits-ci-service
qits ci run 5f2c0a9e-1b7d-4c2e-9a41-3d8e6f0b2c17 -o json | jq -r .status
```

- <run id> is the run's whole id, or its start when --project and --repository name the repository.
- The exit code says whether the read worked, not whether the run passed. Read the status.
- -o json prints the service's answer, the logs included.

### Exit codes

- `0` Done, whatever the run's status.
- `1` The platform refused (for example no such run, HTTP 404), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example an id start that fits no run of the repository, or more than one), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits ci retry

Run a finished CI run again: the same commit, the same pipeline, the same release request.

For a red run that was the platform's fault, not the code's: a flaked container, a registry that was down, a step that ran out of time on a busy host. The new run is queued; the command prints its id and how to follow it. Its verdict counts for the release request like the first run's would have.

```
qits ci retry [--ci-url <url>] [--output table|json] [--project <project>] [--projects-url <url>] [--repository <repository>] <run id>
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `<run id>` | The run to retry: its id, or its start when --project and --repository name its repository. |
| `--ci-url <url>` | The ci service's base URL, without /ci. Default: QITS_CI_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `ci` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://ci.qits.wohlben.eu). |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed, with control characters written as escapes. |
| `--project <project>` | The project: its id, slug or name. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects, where --project and --repository are looked up. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else derived from the idp address like --ci-url. |
| `--repository <repository>` | The repository: its id or name. |

### Examples

```
qits ci retry 5f2c0a9e-1b7d-4c2e-9a41-3d8e6f0b2c17
qits ci retry 5f2c0a9e --project qits --repository qits-ci-service
```

- Only a finished run can be retried. One that is queued or running answers HTTP 409: wait for it.
- A retry builds the same commit. To fix the code, push the branch instead: the release request folds again and builds the new commit.
- Needs the role qits:admin.

### Exit codes

- `0` The new run is queued.
- `1` The platform refused: the run has not finished yet (HTTP 409), there is no such run (HTTP 404), or your roles do not allow it (HTTP 403). Or it cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example an id start that fits no run of the repository, or more than one), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits ci report

Release reports: what a release request's QA run found, beside its verdict. show lists a run's reports with their highlights, and prints one kind's whole report. submit is what every QA step runs after its script: it collects the reports from the step's files and uploads them.

Kinds today: test-results (every test run, and each failing test with its class, name, file and message), coverage (line coverage of the whole tree, its change against the baseline, and the coverage of the lines the change touched), contracts (the pacts the repository holds as consumer or verifies as provider, and the provider states it declares, with the pacts, interactions and states added or removed since the baseline), entity-changes (the generated entity diagrams under docs/database/, with the tables, columns and relations added, removed or changed since the baseline) and screenshots (the committed screenshot baselines added, changed or removed since the baseline, by path and blob, for the release request to show before and after). A kind or a run with nothing to report shows nothing; a report never fails or holds a release.

### Notes

- Each kind and its highlights are computed by the CLI that submitted them; qits-ci keeps them as they came, keyed by run, step and kind.
- A report compares with its baseline: the same kind in the QA run of the release request that produced the repository's newest released version. A first release has none.

## qits ci report submit

Collect this CI step's release reports from its files and upload them to qits-ci. Run in a QA step, after the step's own script, with that script's exit code.

For each kind: find its inputs under --root, parse them, compare with the baseline's report of the same kind, and PUT the result to the run's step. A kind with no inputs is not reported, and nothing is sent for it. One line per kind on stdout: `test-results: submitted (412 tests, 3 failed)`, `coverage: submitted (10031 lines, 80.9% covered)` or `coverage: not reported (no inputs)`.

```
qits ci report submit --exit-code <n> [--root <dir>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--exit-code <n>` | Required. What the step's own script exited with. Kept with the report; a non-zero code with no failing test is a highlight of its own. |
| `--root <dir>` | Where the step's tree is: the reports are looked for, and file paths are relative to, this directory. Default: the working directory. |

### Examples

```
qits ci report submit --exit-code "$qits_step_exit"
qits ci report submit --exit-code 1 --root /workspace/checkout
```

- test-results reads **/target/surefire-reports/TEST-*.xml, **/target/failsafe-reports/TEST-*.xml and .qits-reports/vitest-*.xml. A file that does not parse is skipped with a warning.
- A failing test gets the lines it sits on in its file for Java with surefire or failsafe (the JUnit test method, its annotations included) and for TypeScript or JavaScript with vitest (the it/test block); any other failure has none.
- coverage reads .qits-reports/jacoco.exec (JaCoCo 0.8.14's format) against every **/target/classes and against the classes the agent dumped to .qits-reports/jacoco-classes (a class Quarkus rewrote as it loaded it counts on its original's lines), and coverage/**/coverage-final.json or .qits-reports/coverage/**/coverage-final.json (istanbul's json, as vitest writes it). With a baseline it fetches the baseline's tag (git fetch --depth=1 "$QITS_CI_REPOSITORY_URL" refs/tags/<version>) and measures the lines `git diff -U0 <version> HEAD` names; when git cannot, the diff coverage is left out, with one warning.
- contracts reads pacts/*.json (the committed consumer pacts, Pact v2 to v4), .qits-reports/pact-verification/*.json (Pact-JVM's JSON verification report: the pacts the provider verified) and golden-masters/index.json (the provider states), and only in a step where test-results found a file, so a run reports its tree once.
- entity-changes reads the generated docs/database/*.md (the files `qits database diagram` wrote; a hand-written file there is ignored), only in step 0, and compares them with the same files at the baseline's tag, fetched as for coverage. Without a baseline, or at a baseline from before the diagrams, every unit is CURRENT: the diagram is new.
- screenshots reads the committed screenshot baselines (vitest browser mode's **/__screenshots__/<spec file>/<name>-<browser>-<platform>.png) from `git ls-tree` at HEAD and at the baseline's tag, fetched as for coverage, and lists the NEW, CHANGED and REMOVED ones by path and blob id, never their bytes, with the keys of **/testing/browser/renderer.txt that changed. Only in a step that rendered them: one on the renderer image (/etc/qits-renderer-provenance) or with @qits/angular's run record (node_modules/.cache/@qits/angular/screenshot-references.json); otherwise `screenshots: not reported (not rendered in this step)`, and `(no screenshot baselines)` when neither side holds one. QITS_CI_REPO_ID names the repository for the images. Without a baseline every image is NEW.
- The step's environment says which run and step: QITS_CI_RUN_ID, QITS_CI_STEP_INDEX, QITS_CI_SHA, QITS_CI_REPO_NAME and QITS_CI_PROJECT_ID, all required. qits-ci is https://ci.qits.$QITS_DOMAIN (QITS_DOMAIN defaults to wohlben.eu); no variable and no option names another address.
- The bearer comes from QITS_PUBLISH_TOKEN_COMMAND, QITS_PUBLISH_TOKEN, or QITS_COMMISSIONED_CLIENT_ID and QITS_COMMISSIONED_CLIENT_SECRET, the first that is set, as for `qits artifacts publish`. qits-ci takes only the run's own ci-run token, while the run is running.
- No baseline (a first release, or qits-ci cannot say) is not an error: the report is sent without the comparison.
- A non-zero --exit-code means the step may have stopped part way, so its test count and coverage are partial: they are sent and say so, and never compared with the baseline's.
- Gives up after 120 seconds in all, whatever is still waiting.
- The exit code says whether the reports were stored, never whether the tests passed. The hook that runs this ignores it, so a report never changes a step's verdict.

### Exit codes

- `0` Every kind that found inputs was stored, or no kind found any.
- `1` qits-ci refused a report (the message names the status: 403 for another run's token, 409 for a run that is not running, 404 for a qits-ci without the doors), could not be reached, or did not answer within 120 seconds.
- `2` Used wrongly: --exit-code missing, a QITS_CI_* variable missing, --root not a directory, or no credential in the environment.

## qits ci report show

Show a CI run's release reports: each kind, its version, the step that submitted it, and its highlights ("3 tests failed").

--kind also prints that kind's whole report as JSON: for test-results, the totals, the suites, and each failing test with its file, class, name, shape and message; for coverage, the total, the baseline's total, the changed lines' coverage with the uncovered ones, and a line per file; for contracts, the pacts by role (CONSUMER, PROVIDER) and pair with their interactions, and the provider states with their operations; for entity-changes, each diagram's unit with its status, the tables, columns and relations that changed, and its Mermaid text before and after; for screenshots, the payload: the githost repository id, the fold's and the baseline's commits, the totals, the renderer record's changed keys, and each NEW, CHANGED or REMOVED baseline image with its path, spec, name, browser, blob ids, sizes and any exact move.

```
qits ci report show [--ci-url <url>] [--kind <kind>] [--output table|json] [--project <project>] [--projects-url <url>] [--repository <repository>] <run id>
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `<run id>` | The run: its id, or its start when --project and --repository name its repository. |
| `--ci-url <url>` | The ci service's base URL, without /ci. Default: QITS_CI_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `ci` (https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp gives https://ci.qits.wohlben.eu). |
| `--kind <kind>` | Only this kind of report (test-results, coverage, contracts, entity-changes, screenshots), and print the whole of it. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): aligned columns. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed, with control characters written as escapes. |
| `--project <project>` | The project: its id, slug or name. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects, where --project and --repository are looked up. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else derived from the idp address like --ci-url. |
| `--repository <repository>` | The repository: its id or name. |

### Examples

```
qits ci report show 5f2c0a9e-1b7d-4c2e-9a41-3d8e6f0b2c17
qits ci report show 5f2c0a9e --project qits --repository qits-ci-service --kind test-results
qits ci report show 5f2c0a9e --project qits --repository qits-ci-service --kind coverage
qits ci report show 5f2c0a9e --project qits --repository qits-landing-app --kind contracts
qits ci report show 5f2c0a9e --project qits --repository qits-ci-service --kind entity-changes
qits ci report show 5f2c0a9e --project qits --repository qits-landing-app --kind screenshots
qits ci report show 5f2c0a9e-1b7d-4c2e-9a41-3d8e6f0b2c17 -o json
```

- A release request's QA run is the one with reports: `qits ci runs --release-request <id>` finds it.
- <run id> is the run's whole id, or its start when --project and --repository name the repository.
- -o json prints the service's answer: the summaries, or with --kind the whole reports of that kind.

### Exit codes

- `0` Done, whatever the reports say, and also when the run has none.
- `1` The platform refused (for example no such run, HTTP 404), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (for example an id start that fits no run of the repository, or more than one), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits database

A repository's database, read from its compiled code: `qits database diagram` writes the diagram of its entities under docs/database/, one Mermaid file per persistence unit.

## qits database diagram

Write the entity diagram of a maven repository's JPA mapping: one Markdown file with a Mermaid erDiagram per persistence unit it declares, read from its compiled classes.

Compile first: the classes come from every reactor module's target/classes and the libraries from each module's target/qits-classpath.txt, which `dependency:build-classpath -Dmdep.outputFile=target/qits-classpath.txt -DincludeScope=runtime` writes. One line per file on stdout: `written docs/database/ci.md`, `unchanged ...` or `deleted ...`.

```
qits database diagram [--check] [--out <dir>] [--root <dir>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--check` | Write and delete nothing; exit 1 when a file would change. Lines say `would write` and `would delete`. |
| `--out <dir>` | Where the files go. Default: docs/database under --root. |
| `--root <dir>` | The repository: the directory of its root pom.xml. Default: the working directory. |

### Examples

```
./mvnw -q -Dmaven.test.skip=true test-compile dependency:build-classpath -Dmdep.outputFile=target/qits-classpath.txt -DincludeScope=runtime
qits database diagram
qits database diagram --root . --out docs/database --check
```

- test-compile rather than compile: dependency:build-classpath resolves the test scope too, and in a reactor where one module depends on another's test jar that resolution fails at compile. -Dmaven.test.skip=true still compiles no test. The scope flag is -DincludeScope: the plugin reads no -Dmdep.includeScope, and with it the file lists every scope, the test jars too.
- A unit is an unprofiled quarkus.hibernate-orm.<unit>.packages key (quarkus.hibernate-orm.packages is <default>, written to default.md) in a reactor module's own application.properties or META-INF/microprofile-config.properties, never a library's. A profiled key or a ${...} value is ignored, with a warning on stderr.
- A unit draws every @Entity in its packages and their sub-packages, compiled here or in a library jar; each table names its origin, the reactor module or the library's artifactId. An entity of the repository that no unit lists is drawn in a file named after its Java package.
- Names are Hibernate's under Quarkus' defaults: JPA's implicit naming, and every name as the mapping spells it, unless the unit's physical-naming-strategy key names CamelCaseToUnderscoresNamingStrategy (then snake_case). A construct the diagram does not draw (@OneToOne, @ManyToMany, @EmbeddedId, @Inheritance, @SecondaryTable, @Formula and others) is listed under it as `Not drawn`, never refused.
- Deletes only the *.md files under --out that start with the generator's header and were not written this time. A file without the header is never touched.
- The files hold no version, time or absolute path: two runs over the same classes write the same bytes.
- Reads local files only: it needs no sign-in and calls no service.

### Exit codes

- `0` Done, or nothing to draw (`no JPA entities found`).
- `1` With --check: a file would be written or deleted. Otherwise: a file could not be read or written.
- `2` Used wrongly: --root is not a directory, or nothing is compiled under it (`compile first: no target/classes under <root>`).

## qits maintenance

Jobs of qits-maintenance: automations lists a release request's release-request automations and their state, automation run re-runs one kind, and bump shows how one job went.

### Notes

- --project, --repository, --output and the two -url options may come before or after the command.

## qits maintenance automations

List a release request's release-request automations and their state: the regenerations that must be fresh before the request can proceed, each one a kind the platform decided applies to this repository.

The request holds until every automation that applies to the repository is fresh for its merged commit. --fold reads an older fold; without it, the request's newest one.

```
qits maintenance automations --request <id> [--fold <sha>] [--maintenance-url <url>] [--output table|json] [--project <project>] [--projects-url <url>] [--repository <repository>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--request <id>` | Required. The release request: its id as `qits release-request list` shows it (qits-landing-app-rr-7), its uuid, or the start of the uuid. |
| `--fold <sha>` | The fold to read; without it, the request's newest. |
| `--maintenance-url <url>` | The maintenance service's base URL, without /maintenance. Default: QITS_MAINTENANCE_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `maintenance`. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): one line per field. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--project <project>` | The project: its id, slug or name. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects, where --project, --repository and --request are looked up. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else derived like --maintenance-url. |
| `--repository <repository>` | The repository: its id or name. |

### Examples

```
qits maintenance --project qits --repository qits-landing-app automations --request qits-landing-app-rr-7
```

- RUN is the newest run of the kind's current attempt. `qits maintenance automation run` re-runs one; `qits ci run <id> --logs` shows a run.

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits maintenance automation

One release-request automation of a release request. `run` re-runs a kind on the request's current fold.

## qits maintenance automation run

Re-run one release-request automation on a release request's current fold.

It skips carry-over and applicability, so a repository's first screenshot references come from here. The kind's own precondition still refuses the run with a sentence (no `test:browser` script, for example). It prints the job's id; `qits maintenance bump <id>` shows how it went.

```
qits maintenance automation run --kind <kind> --request <id> [--maintenance-url <url>] [--output table|json] [--project <project>] [--projects-url <url>] [--repository <repository>] [--work-item <id>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--kind <kind>` | Required. The automation's kind, as `qits maintenance automations --request <id>` names it. |
| `--request <id>` | Required. The release request: its id as `qits release-request list` shows it (qits-landing-app-rr-7), its uuid, or the start of the uuid. |
| `--maintenance-url <url>` | The maintenance service's base URL, without /maintenance. Default: QITS_MAINTENANCE_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `maintenance`. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): one line per field. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--project <project>` | The project: its id, slug or name. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects, where --project, --repository and --request are looked up. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else derived like --maintenance-url. |
| `--repository <repository>` | The repository: its id or name. |
| `--work-item <id>` | The work item the commit names, for example qits-112. |

### Examples

```
qits maintenance --project qits --repository qits-landing-app automation run --request qits-landing-app-rr-7 --kind estate-pins
qits maintenance --project qits --repository qits-landing-app automation run --request qits-landing-app-rr-7 --kind estate-pins --work-item qits-112
```

- `qits maintenance automations --request <id>` names the kinds; `kind` is the first column.
- 404 means the kind or the repository is not one the platform knows. 409 means one is already running for this (request, kind), the request takes no branch, or bumping is off.
- --work-item is the commit subject's scope (chore(<work item>): update <label>). Without it, the newest one named on the request's own commits is used.

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits maintenance bump

Show one qits-maintenance job: its mode, status, the sentence about how it went, and the commit it left.

```
qits maintenance bump [--maintenance-url <url>] [--output table|json] [--project <project>] [--projects-url <url>] [--repository <repository>] <id>
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `<id>` | The job's id, as the request printed it. |
| `--maintenance-url <url>` | The maintenance service's base URL, without /maintenance. Default: QITS_MAINTENANCE_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `maintenance`. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): one line per field. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed. |
| `--project <project>` | The project: its id, slug or name. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects, where --project, --repository and --request are looked up. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else derived like --maintenance-url. |
| `--repository <repository>` | The repository: its id or name. |

### Examples

```
qits maintenance bump 6f1c2d3e-4a5b-6c7d-8e9f-0a1b2c3d4e5f
```

- Run it again to follow a job: REQUESTED and RUNNING are not finished.

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits users

The people who sign in to the platform, on the idp: invite mints a register token, register spends one on a new username and shows the generated password once, list shows the users and their roles, and delete removes one.

invite, list and delete need qits:admin; register needs only the token, and no sign-in.

### Notes

- --output and --idp-url may come before or after the command.

## qits users invite

Mint a register token for one new user, and print it.

The token registers one user, once, with the platform's bootstrap roles. It is printed alone on stdout and nowhere else: hand it to the person privately, and they run `qits users register`. Lost, it is simply never spent; mint another. Needs qits:admin.

```
qits users invite [--idp-url <url>] [--output table|json]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--idp-url <url>` | The idp's base URL, with /idp. Default: the session's idp; inside the platform its wire alias; for register with no session, QITS_IDP_URL, else the address `qits login` uses. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): for people. json: the answer as JSON, pretty-printed. |

### Examples

```
qits users invite
qits users invite -o json
```

- -o json prints the idp's answer: the token's id, the token and when it was minted.
- Not served by the qits MCP server: the token would land in a transcript.

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The idp refused (HTTP 403: the caller is not qits:admin), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits users register

Spend a register token on a new username, and print the password the idp generated for it.

THE PASSWORD IS SHOWN ONLY THIS ONCE: it is printed alone on stdout, never written to a file or a log, and nobody can show it again. Store it before you do anything else. Needs no sign-in: the token is the credential. A refused username leaves the token unspent.

```
qits users register --token <token> [--idp-url <url>] [--output table|json] <username>
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `<username>` | The new user's name. |
| `--token <token>` | Required. The register token `qits users invite` printed. This call spends it. |
| `--idp-url <url>` | The idp's base URL, with /idp. Default: the session's idp; inside the platform its wire alias; for register with no session, QITS_IDP_URL, else the address `qits login` uses. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): for people. json: the answer as JSON, pretty-printed. |

### Examples

```
qits users register --token <token> jan
qits users register --token <token> jan -o json
```

- -o json prints {"username": ..., "password": ...} and nothing of the session the idp opens.
- Then sign in with `qits login`.
- Not served by the qits MCP server: the password would land in a transcript.

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The idp refused the token (unknown or spent) or the username (taken, or not a valid one), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly.

## qits users list

List the users: name, when each registered, and their roles. Needs qits:admin.

```
qits users list [--idp-url <url>] [--output table|json]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--idp-url <url>` | The idp's base URL, with /idp. Default: the session's idp; inside the platform its wire alias; for register with no session, QITS_IDP_URL, else the address `qits login` uses. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): for people. json: the answer as JSON, pretty-printed. |

### Examples

```
qits users list
qits users list -o json
```

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The idp refused (HTTP 403: the caller is not qits:admin), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits users delete

Delete a user: their sign-ins and sessions go with them. Needs qits:admin, and nobody can delete themselves.

```
qits users delete [--idp-url <url>] [--output table|json] <username>
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `<username>` | The user to delete. |
| `--idp-url <url>` | The idp's base URL, with /idp. Default: the session's idp; inside the platform its wire alias; for register with no session, QITS_IDP_URL, else the address `qits login` uses. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): for people. json: the answer as JSON, pretty-printed. |

### Examples

```
qits users delete jan
```

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The idp refused: no such user (404), it is you (409), the caller is not qits:admin (403), or it cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits events

Print qits-events domain events as they happen, one JSON object per line on stdout. Use it to watch the platform: builds (BuildStatusChanged), release requests (ReleaseRequestStateChanged). To wait for something, do not keep this running: declare it with `qits wait` and end your turn.

Each line is the event with its payload read as JSON. Live only: the stream has no replay, so start it before the thing you wait for; events that happen while it reconnects are missed. Notes go to stderr. Stops on SIGINT or SIGTERM.

```
qits events [--events-url <url>] [--filter <names>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--events-url <url>` | The events service's base URL, without /events. Default: QITS_EVENTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `events`. |
| `--filter <names>` | Which events, as services subscribe to them: exact event names, comma-separated (for example BuildSuccessful,BuildFailed), or * for every event. No patterns. Default: *. |

### Examples

```
qits events --filter=BuildSuccessful,BuildFailed
qits events --filter=ReleaseRequestStateChanged | jq -r '.payload'
```

--filter takes exact event names. A pattern such as Build* is refused.

### Exit codes

- `0` Stopped by SIGINT or SIGTERM, or stdout was closed.
- `1` The platform refused the stream (401, 403 or another 4xx).
- `2` Used wrongly (for example a pattern in --filter), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits events query

Print the qits-events domain events that already happened in a window of time, oldest first, from the events log. It answers with what exists when it is called and never waits for a new event; `qits events` is the live form.

The window is --since to --until, both inclusive; --since is an hour ago and --until is now unless given. When more than --limit events fall in it, the newest --limit are kept. The text form starts with a line giving the window as two absolute instants, then prints one JSON object per event, the same line `qits events` prints, and ends with a line saying so when the answer was cut. -o json prints one object: {"events": [...], "truncated": true|false, "window": {"since": ..., "until": ...}}.

```
qits events query [--events-url <url>] [--filter <names>] [--limit <n>] [--output <text|json>] [--since <time>] [--until <time>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--events-url <url>` | The events service's base URL, without /events. Default: QITS_EVENTS_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `events`. |
| `--filter <names>` | Which events: exact event names, comma-separated (for example BuildSuccessful,BuildFailed), or * for every event. No patterns. Default: *. |
| `--limit <n>` | At most this many, 1 to 1000. When more match, the newest are kept. Default: 100. |
| `-o, --output <text\|json>` | text: the window, then one line per event (the default). json: one object with the events, whether the answer was cut, and the window. |
| `--since <time>` | Where the window starts, inclusive: an ISO-8601 instant (2026-10-01T18:00:00Z) or a time back from now, a whole number with s, m, h or d (90s, 15m, 2h, 7d). Default: 1h. |
| `--until <time>` | Where the window ends, inclusive, in the same two forms. A time after now is taken as now. Default: now. |

### Examples

```
qits events query --filter=BuildFailed --since 1d
qits events query --filter=ReleaseRequestChanged --since 2026-10-01T18:00:00Z --until 2026-10-01T19:00:00Z
qits events query --since 15m -o json | jq -r '.events[].name'
```

--filter takes exact event names, as `qits events` does. A pattern such as Build* is refused.

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (a pattern in --filter, a time that cannot be read, --since after --until, a --limit outside 1..1000), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits observe

Print what qits-observability takes in (logs, spans with their events, metrics) as it arrives. Use it to watch a service's errors or to follow one trace live. The service applies the filters and sends only the records that match.

Each --filter is one group of conditions, separated by spaces, that must all hold. A record that fits any group is printed. Live only: records that arrive while it reconnects are missed. Notes go to stderr. Stops on SIGINT or SIGTERM.

Conditions: F=V equal and F^=V starts with (both match case: status=ERROR, not status=error), F~V contains (any case), F? present, !F absent, level>=V severity at or above V (TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL or 1-24).

Fields: kind service trace span level body name status event attr.<key> resource.<key>. attr.<key> is the record's own attribute, resource.<key> its resource's. Quote a value that holds spaces: body~"connection refused".

Subcommands read what the buffer holds now and do not wait: query searches it with these filters, sources lists its buckets, and errors, slow-spans and metrics sum up one bucket.

```
qits observe [--filter <conditions>...] [--observability-url <url>] [--output <text|json>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--filter <conditions>...` | Required. One group of conditions, for example 'kind=log level>=ERROR'. Give it again for another group. '*' streams every record. |
| `--observability-url <url>` | The observability service's base URL, without /observability. Default: QITS_OBSERVABILITY_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `observability`. |
| `-o, --output <text\|json>` | text: one line per record (the default). json: each record's frame as the service sends it, one per line. |

### Examples

```
qits observe --filter 'kind=log level>=ERROR' --filter 'kind=span event=exception'
qits observe --filter 'service^=qits-ci kind=log body~"connection refused"'
qits observe --filter 'trace=4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736'
qits observe --filter 'kind=log level>=WARN' -o json | jq -r .record.body
qits observe --filter 'service=qits-ci-daemon'
qits observe --filter 'service=qits-ci-daemon resource.qits.ci.run_id=5f2c0a9e-1b7d-4c2e-9a41-3d8e6f0b2c17'
```

- A span's exception is an event of the span: event=exception finds it. attr.exception.type? matches logs only.
- F=V and F^=V match case: status=ERROR, not status=error. F~V ignores case.
- level takes >= only (level>=WARN), and only logs have a level.
- --filter '*' streams every record, which can be a lot.

### Exit codes

- `0` Stopped by SIGINT or SIGTERM, or stdout was closed.
- `1` The platform refused the socket (401, 403 or another 4xx).
- `2` A --filter cannot be read or the service refused the filters, not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits observe query

Print the logs, spans and metrics qits-observability still holds for a window of time, oldest first, filtered as `qits observe` filters. It answers with what the service holds when it is called and never waits for a new record; `qits observe` is the live form.

The window is --since to --until, both inclusive; --since is an hour ago and --until is now unless given. A record is in the window by its own time: a log's time, a span's start. A metric keeps only its latest point, so a metric is found only when that point is in the window. When more than --limit records match, the newest --limit are kept.

The service keeps a bounded buffer, not a history. When the window starts before the oldest record it still holds, a note on stderr says so: an empty answer there is not proof that nothing happened.

The text form starts with a line giving the window as two absolute instants, then prints one line per record, the line `qits observe` prints, and ends with a line saying so when the answer was cut. -o json prints one object: {"records": [...], "truncated": true|false, "window": {"since": ..., "until": ...}}, each record the frame the live stream sends.

--filter takes the conditions and fields `qits observe` takes; see `qits observe --help`.

```
qits observe query --filter <conditions>... [--limit <n>] [--observability-url <url>] [--output <text|json>] [--since <time>] [--source <key>] [--until <time>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--filter <conditions>...` | Required. One group of conditions, for example 'kind=log level>=ERROR'. Give it again for another group. '*' matches every record. |
| `--limit <n>` | At most this many, 1 to 1000. When more match, the newest are kept. Default: 100. |
| `--observability-url <url>` | The observability service's base URL, without /observability. Default: QITS_OBSERVABILITY_URL, else the session's idp address with `idp` swapped for `observability`. |
| `-o, --output <text\|json>` | text: the window, then one line per record (the default). json: one object with the records, whether the answer was cut, and the window. |
| `--since <time>` | Where the window starts, inclusive: an ISO-8601 instant (2026-10-01T18:00:00Z) or a time back from now, a whole number with s, m, h or d (90s, 15m, 2h, 7d). Default: 1h. |
| `--source <key>` | Only this source's records: a key such as _service/qits-ci. Default: every source. |
| `--until <time>` | Where the window ends, inclusive, in the same two forms. A time after now is taken as now. Default: now. |

### Examples

```
qits observe query --filter 'kind=log level>=ERROR' --since 2h
qits observe query --filter 'trace=4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736' --since 1d --limit 1000
qits observe query --filter 'kind=span status=ERROR' --source _service/qits-ci -o json
```

- --source takes a key as the service's telemetry sources list it (_service/<name>, a repository or a workspace). Without it every source is searched.

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (a --filter that cannot be read or that the service refused, a time that cannot be read, --since after --until, a --limit outside 1..1000), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits observe sources

List the buckets qits-observability holds telemetry in: each one's key, kind (SERVICE, WORKSPACE or UNSCOPED), label, repository and workspace ids, and how many spans, logs and metric series it holds.

## qits wait

Declare what this agent waits on: a domain event that fits a selection. The platform gives the agent a turn when one arrives, or when the timeout passes. The command returns at once; it never blocks.

Bare, it takes the event's name and its conditions. release-request, work and ci-run are presets for the usual waits; list shows this agent's waits and cancel ends one.

Each --when is one group of conditions, separated by spaces, that must all hold. An event that fits any group matches; with no --when, every event of the name does. Conditions: path=value equal, path^=value starts with, path? present, !path absent. A path is the payload's fields joined by dots; [] after a field means some element of that array, and the conditions of one group that go through the same name[] must hold on the same element (entities[].entityId=<id> entities[].status=VERIFIED). Quote a value that holds spaces or is empty: label="two words", note="". At most 8 groups of 8 conditions.

The agent is --agent, else QITS_AGENT_ID: the harness sets it in an agent's environment, and the MCP server sets it from the caller's token. An agent may declare and cancel waits for itself only.

```
qits wait [--agent <id>] [--event <Name>] [--label <text>] [--output table|json] [--timeout <duration>] [--when <conditions>...] [--workspaces-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--agent <id>` | The agent whose waits these are. Default: QITS_AGENT_ID (on the MCP server, from the caller's token). |
| `--event <Name>` | Required, unless a preset is named. The event's name, as the bus carries it: BuildFailed, EntityTransitioned. |
| `--label <text>` | What the agent waits on, in a few words. The platform shows the agent as `waiting on <label>`. A preset gives one of its own. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): the wait for a person. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed, with control characters written as escapes. |
| `--timeout <duration>` | Close the wait and wake the agent after this long, if nothing fitted: 30m, 2h, 1h30m, 1d or ISO-8601 (PT2H). Default: no timeout. |
| `--when <conditions>...` | One group of conditions, for example 'runId=<id> status=SUCCESS'. Give it again for another group, up to 8. Without one, every event of the name fits. |
| `--workspaces-url <url>` | The workspaces service's base URL, without /workspaces. Default: QITS_WORKSPACES_URL, else derived from the idp address, like the other services. |

### Waiting on the platform

- Declare the wait, then end your turn. You get a new turn that names what fired: the event, or the timeout.
- Never poll in a background loop (sleep, watch, `qits events`) for something a wait can say.
- While a wait is open, the platform shows the agent as waiting on its label, not as blocked.
- A wait closes when it fires, times out or is cancelled. Declare a new one to wait again.

```
qits wait release-request qits-ci-service-rr-12
qits wait work qits-123 --status VERIFIED --timeout 2h
qits wait ci-run 0d9e8f7a-6b5c-4d3e-8f2a-1b0c9d8e7f6a
qits wait --event BuildFailed --when 'repoName=qits-ci-service branch=main' --label 'main to break'
qits wait --event EntityTransitioned --when 'entities[].status=VERIFIED' --timeout 30m
qits wait list --state OPEN
qits wait cancel 7c1e2d3f-0000-4000-8000-000000000001
```

### Exit codes

- `0` The wait is declared; it is printed.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (no agent id, no --event, a --when or --timeout that cannot be read or is over a limit), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits wait release-request

Wait until a release request ends: FINALIZED, REJECTED, FAILED, WITHDRAWN or OBSOLETE.

The same as --event ReleaseRequestStateChanged with one group per final state: releaseRequestQualifiedId=<id> state=<STATE>, or releaseRequestId=<uuid> state=<STATE> for a uuid.

```
qits wait release-request [--agent <id>] [--label <text>] [--output table|json] [--timeout <duration>] [--workspaces-url <url>] <id>
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `<id>` | The release request: its id (qits-ci-service-rr-12) or its whole uuid. |
| `--agent <id>` | The agent whose waits these are. Default: QITS_AGENT_ID (on the MCP server, from the caller's token). |
| `--label <text>` | What the agent waits on, in a few words. The platform shows the agent as `waiting on <label>`. A preset gives one of its own. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): the wait for a person. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed, with control characters written as escapes. |
| `--timeout <duration>` | Close the wait and wake the agent after this long, if nothing fitted: 30m, 2h, 1h30m, 1d or ISO-8601 (PT2H). Default: no timeout. |
| `--workspaces-url <url>` | The workspaces service's base URL, without /workspaces. Default: QITS_WORKSPACES_URL, else derived from the idp address, like the other services. |

### Examples

```
qits wait release-request qits-ci-service-rr-12
qits wait release-request qits-ci-service-rr-12 --timeout 3h
qits wait release-request 4f2a91c0-1d2e-4c3b-9a8f-0123456789ab
```

- Give the whole id, as `qits release-request list` shows it, or the whole uuid. The wait matches it exactly, so the start of a uuid is refused, and the id must be in the case the list shows.

### Exit codes

- `0` The wait is declared; it is printed.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (no agent id, not a whole id or uuid), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits wait work

Wait until a work item reaches a status.

The item is looked up in the projects service first, so its qualified id (qits-123) works. The same as --event EntityTransitioned --when 'entities[].entityId=<its id> entities[].status=<STATUS>'.

```
qits wait work --status <STATUS> [--agent <id>] [--label <text>] [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>] [--timeout <duration>] [--workspaces-url <url>] <entity>
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `<entity>` | The work item: its qualified id (qits-123) or its id. |
| `--status <STATUS>` | Required. The status to wait for: REFINED, READY_FOR_DEV, IMPLEMENTED, VERIFIED, DONE, DROPPED or another word of the item's lifecycle. |
| `--agent <id>` | The agent whose waits these are. Default: QITS_AGENT_ID (on the MCP server, from the caller's token). |
| `--label <text>` | What the agent waits on, in a few words. The platform shows the agent as `waiting on <label>`. A preset gives one of its own. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): the wait for a person. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed, with control characters written as escapes. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects, where the item is looked up. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else derived from the idp address. |
| `--timeout <duration>` | Close the wait and wake the agent after this long, if nothing fitted: 30m, 2h, 1h30m, 1d or ISO-8601 (PT2H). Default: no timeout. |
| `--workspaces-url <url>` | The workspaces service's base URL, without /workspaces. Default: QITS_WORKSPACES_URL, else derived from the idp address, like the other services. |

### Examples

```
qits wait work qits-123 --status VERIFIED
qits wait work qits-123 --status DONE --timeout 1d --label 'qits-123 to be done'
```

### Exit codes

- `0` The wait is declared; it is printed.
- `1` The platform refused (for example an item it does not know, HTTP 404), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (no agent id, no --status), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits wait ci-run

Wait until a CI run ends: SUCCESS, FAILED, CANCELLED, CONFIG_ERROR or TIMED_OUT.

The same as --event BuildStatusChanged with one group per final status: runId=<id> status=<STATUS>.

```
qits wait ci-run [--agent <id>] [--label <text>] [--output table|json] [--timeout <duration>] [--workspaces-url <url>] <run id>
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `<run id>` | The run's whole id. |
| `--agent <id>` | The agent whose waits these are. Default: QITS_AGENT_ID (on the MCP server, from the caller's token). |
| `--label <text>` | What the agent waits on, in a few words. The platform shows the agent as `waiting on <label>`. A preset gives one of its own. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): the wait for a person. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed, with control characters written as escapes. |
| `--timeout <duration>` | Close the wait and wake the agent after this long, if nothing fitted: 30m, 2h, 1h30m, 1d or ISO-8601 (PT2H). Default: no timeout. |
| `--workspaces-url <url>` | The workspaces service's base URL, without /workspaces. Default: QITS_WORKSPACES_URL, else derived from the idp address, like the other services. |

### Examples

```
qits wait ci-run 0d9e8f7a-6b5c-4d3e-8f2a-1b0c9d8e7f6a
```

- Give the whole id: `qits ci runs ... -o json` shows it.

### Exit codes

- `0` The wait is declared; it is printed.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (no agent id, not a whole id), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits wait list

This agent's waits: id, state, event, label, when it was declared and when it times out.

```
qits wait list [--agent <id>] [--output table|json] [--state <STATE>] [--workspaces-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|

```

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly (no agent id, a state qits does not know), not signed in, or the session ended.

## qits wait cancel

End one of this agent's open waits. The agent gets no turn for it.

```

## qits workspaces

The workspaces of qits-workspaces, with every action the landing app's workspace pages offer, each on the same door the page calls: the slots and their containers, the agents working in them (agents), and the runners the slots are placed on (runners).

A slot is a workspace row, named by its number (`qits workspaces list` shows it). It hosts agents; an agent works on one work item. Starting a container is a technical process, whose log `qits workspaces log` follows.

### Notes

- Reads are open to every credential, qits:agent included. Writes on the JSON API need qits:admin or qits:admin-agent, which a person's token carries; qits:agent is refused (HTTP 403) by design. Each command's help names its door.
- What an agent's tabs show (its files, its chat, its harness, sign-in and plugins) comes from the slot's daemon, through qits-workspaces' container proxy, which checks the caller: a person, qits:system, qits:admin or qits:admin-agent may reach any slot, qits:agent only its own workspace's.
- `qits workspaces attach` is the agent's Terminal tab: it attaches this terminal to a command's terminal on the slot's daemon. The live chat socket stays the landing app's: the CLI reads the chat's transcript and sends prompts.
- --workspaces-url, --projects-url and --output may come before or after the command.

## qits workspaces list

The ACTIVE workspace slots of one repository, named by --repository: each with its container, placement and runner. The project's Workspaces page.

GET /workspaces/api/workspaces?repositoryId=. Any credential may read it, qits:agent included.

```
qits workspaces list --repository <repository> [--output table|json] [--project <project>] [--projects-url <url>] [--workspaces-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--repository <repository>` | Required. The wrapper repository whose slots to list: its uuid (as `qits repositories list -o json` shows it), or, with --project, its id or name. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): for a person. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed, with control characters written as escapes. |
| `--project <project>` | The project: its id, slug or name. Needed only when --repository names the repository rather than giving its uuid. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects, where a work item's qualified id (qits-123) is looked up. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else derived from the idp address. |
| `--workspaces-url <url>` | The workspaces service's base URL, without /workspaces. Default: QITS_WORKSPACES_URL, else derived from the idp address, like the other services. |

### Examples

## qits workspaces start

Bring a slot's container up, or join the start already running. Start on a slot's page.

POST /workspaces/api/workspaces/{id}/ensure-container, no body. It needs qits:admin or qits:admin-agent, which a person's token carries. qits:agent is refused (HTTP 403) by design: an agent keeps every read and loses the writes.

```

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits workspaces stop

Stop a slot's container. Stop on a slot's page.

POST /workspaces/api/workspaces/{id}/stop-container, no body. It needs qits:admin or qits:admin-agent, which a person's token carries. qits:agent is refused (HTTP 403) by design: an agent keeps every read and loses the writes.

```
qits workspaces stop [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>] [--workspaces-url <url>] <workspace>
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|

## qits workspaces recreate

Replace a slot's container with a new one. Recreate on a slot's page.

POST /workspaces/api/workspaces/{id}/recreate-container, no body. It needs qits:admin or qits:admin-agent, which a person's token carries. qits:agent is refused (HTTP 403) by design: an agent keeps every read and loses the writes.

```
qits workspaces recreate [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>] [--workspaces-url <url>] <workspace>
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `<workspace>` | The slot's number. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): for a person. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed, with control characters written as escapes. |

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits workspaces log

Follow a technical process's log, such as a container's start, until the process ends: its segments, their lines and how each settled. The log of a slot's page.

Each connection replays what the process logged so far, then streams. With -o json, one frame per line as the service sends it; pings are left out. Stops on SIGINT or SIGTERM too.

GET /workspaces/api/technical-processes/{id}/events (Server-Sent Events). Any credential may read it, qits:agent included.

```
qits workspaces log [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>] [--workspaces-url <url>] <process>
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `<process>` | The technical process's id. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): for a person. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed, with control characters written as escapes. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects, where a work item's qualified id (qits-123) is looked up. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else derived from the idp address. |
| `--workspaces-url <url>` | The workspaces service's base URL, without /workspaces. Default: QITS_WORKSPACES_URL, else derived from the idp address, like the other services. |

### Examples

```
qits workspaces log 00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000100
```

- `qits workspaces start` and `qits workspaces active-process` name the process.

### Exit codes

- `0` The process ended, or the command was stopped.
- `1` The platform refused (for example a process it does not know, HTTP 404), or the stream dropped.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits workspaces attach

Attach this terminal to a command's terminal on a slot's daemon: what you type goes to the command, what it prints comes here. The agent's Terminal tab in the landing app.

Command ids come from `qits workspaces agents sign-in open` (the sign-in terminal) and `qits workspaces agents harness` (an agent's harness, when it runs as a terminal); both also take --attach, which opens or finds the command and attaches at once.

Ctrl-] detaches and leaves the command running; Ctrl-C and every other key go to the command. The window's size goes along and follows the window. The command ending ends this too. A dropped connection attaches again after 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 4 s, and the screen is cleared before the daemon replays up to 256 KB of what the terminal held.

With stdin not a terminal (a pipe, a script, `qits tui`) it only streams what the command prints: nothing is typed and the size is left alone. It still ends when the command does.

WS /workspaces/container/{slot}/terminal/commands/{commandId}. It goes through qits-workspaces' container proxy to the slot's daemon. A person, qits:system, qits:admin or qits:admin-agent may reach any slot; qits:agent only its own workspace's.

```
qits workspaces attach --workspace <n> [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>] [--workspaces-url <url>] <command>
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `<command>` | The command's id. |
| `--workspace <n>` | Required. The slot whose daemon runs the command: its number, as `qits workspaces list` shows it. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): for a person. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed, with control characters written as escapes. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects, where a work item's qualified id (qits-123) is looked up. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else derived from the idp address. |
| `--workspaces-url <url>` | The workspaces service's base URL, without /workspaces. Default: QITS_WORKSPACES_URL, else derived from the idp address, like the other services. |

### Examples

```
qits workspaces attach 00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000100 --workspace 1
qits workspaces attach 00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000100 --workspace 1 > terminal.log
```

- Detaching never ends the command. End it with `qits workspaces agents terminate`.
- Not an MCP tool: it needs a terminal and runs until the command ends.

### Exit codes

- `0` The command ended, you detached (Ctrl-]), or it was stopped (SIGINT, SIGTERM); only the first ends the command.
- `1` The platform refused the socket, or the connection dropped and five attempts to attach again failed.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits workspaces items

The work items that have an ACTIVE workspace: the Workspace links on the work pages.

GET /workspaces/api/work/workspaces. Any credential may read it, qits:agent included.

```
qits workspaces items [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>] [--workspaces-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): for a person. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed, with control characters written as escapes. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects, where a work item's qualified id (qits-123) is looked up. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else derived from the idp address. |
| `--workspaces-url <url>` | The workspaces service's base URL, without /workspaces. Default: QITS_WORKSPACES_URL, else derived from the idp address, like the other services. |

### Examples

```
qits workspaces items
```

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits workspaces history

One work item's workspaces in every state, newest first: state, branch, opened and closed. The work item page's list.

GET /workspaces/api/work/{workRef}/workspaces. Any credential may read it, qits:agent included.

```
qits workspaces history [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>] [--workspaces-url <url>] <work>
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `<work>` | The work item: its qualified id (qits-123) or its id. The service takes either. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): for a person. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed, with control characters written as escapes. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects, where a work item's qualified id (qits-123) is looked up. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else derived from the idp address. |
| `--workspaces-url <url>` | The workspaces service's base URL, without /workspaces. Default: QITS_WORKSPACES_URL, else derived from the idp address, like the other services. |

### Examples

```
qits workspaces history qits-123
```

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits workspaces agents

The agents in the workspace slots: list, create and discard them, send one a prompt, keep its prompt draft, read its chat, and what its tabs show of its container (files, harness, sign-in, plugins).

An agent is named by its id (`qits workspaces agents list` shows it); a work item by its qualified id (qits-123) or its id. The commands that read the agent's container take its slot with --workspace.

### Notes

- create, discard, prompt, draft save and draft discard need qits:admin or qits:admin-agent; qits:agent is refused (HTTP 403) by design. The reads are open to it, and so is everything that goes through the container proxy (chat, terminate, refine, harness, files, sign-in, plugins).

## qits workspaces agents list

Agents, newest first: what each works on, its slot, how it runs and what it waits on. Bare, every agent (the project's Workspaces page); --work, one item's (its agent page); --workspace, one slot's (the slot's page); --state ACTIVE, the In Progress tab's.

GET /workspaces/api/agents[?workId=&workspaceId=&state=]. Any credential may read it, qits:agent included.

```
qits workspaces agents list [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>] [--state <STATE>] [--work <work>] [--workspace <n>] [--workspaces-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): for a person. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed, with control characters written as escapes. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects, where a work item's qualified id (qits-123) is looked up. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else derived from the idp address. |
| `--state <STATE>` | Only the agents in this state: ACTIVE or REMOVED. Default: all. |
| `--work <work>` | Only this work item's agents: its qualified id (qits-123) or its id. |
| `--workspace <n>` | Only the agents this slot hosts. |
| `--workspaces-url <url>` | The workspaces service's base URL, without /workspaces. Default: QITS_WORKSPACES_URL, else derived from the idp address, like the other services. |

### Examples

```
qits workspaces agents list --state ACTIVE
qits workspaces agents list --work qits-123
qits workspaces agents list --workspace 1 -o json
```

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits workspaces agents create

Start an agent on a ticket or an epic, in a harness and posture of your choosing. An item that already has an ACTIVE agent answers that one (fresh: false). Create agent on the Workspaces page.

POST /workspaces/api/agents with {repositoryId, workId, entityId, kind, admin, harness?, instruction?}. It needs qits:admin or qits:admin-agent, which a person's token carries. qits:agent is refused (HTTP 403) by design: an agent keeps every read and loses the writes.

```
qits workspaces agents create --repository <id> --work <work> [--admin] [--entity <qualified id>] [--harness CLAUDE|KIMI] [--instruction <text>] [--kind TICKET|EPIC] [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>] [--workspaces-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--repository <id>` | Required. The wrapper repository the agent works in: its id. |
| `--work <work>` | Required. The work item: its qualified id (qits-123) or its id. |
| `--admin` | Admin mode: the agent runs in a slot that holds the host's docker socket. |
| `--entity <qualified id>` | The item's qualified id, sent as entityId. Default: the one the lookup of --work found. |
| `--harness CLAUDE\|KIMI` | The harness the agent runs in. Default: the service's. |
| `--instruction <text>` | The agent's first turn. |
| `--kind TICKET\|EPIC` | What the item is. Default: EPIC for an epic the lookup found, else TICKET. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): for a person. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed, with control characters written as escapes. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects, where a work item's qualified id (qits-123) is looked up. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else derived from the idp address. |
| `--workspaces-url <url>` | The workspaces service's base URL, without /workspaces. Default: QITS_WORKSPACES_URL, else derived from the idp address, like the other services. |

### Examples

```
qits workspaces agents create --repository 0d9e8f7a-6b5c-4d3e-8f2a-1b0c9d8e7f6a --work qits-123
qits workspaces agents create --repository <id> --work qits-120 --kind EPIC --harness CLAUDE --instruction 'Plan the epic first.'
```

- A qualified id is looked up in the projects service for the item's id; it is sent as entityId, and an EPIC item makes --kind EPIC unless --kind says otherwise.

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits workspaces agents discard

Remove an agent: its worktrees, credential and draft go. Discard on a slot's or an item's agent page; --force is Discard anyway.

POST /workspaces/api/agents/{id}/discard with {"force": false|true}. It needs qits:admin or qits:admin-agent, which a person's token carries. qits:agent is refused (HTTP 403) by design: an agent keeps every read and loses the writes.

```
qits workspaces agents discard [--force] [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>] [--workspaces-url <url>] <agent>
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `<agent>` | The agent's id. |
| `--force` | Remove it despite leftover work or a daemon that does not answer. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): for a person. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed, with control characters written as escapes. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects, where a work item's qualified id (qits-123) is looked up. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else derived from the idp address. |
| `--workspaces-url <url>` | The workspaces service's base URL, without /workspaces. Default: QITS_WORKSPACES_URL, else derived from the idp address, like the other services. |

### Examples

```
qits workspaces agents discard 00000000-0000-4000-8000-0000000000a1
qits workspaces agents discard 00000000-0000-4000-8000-0000000000a1 --force
```

- Without --force the service refuses (HTTP 409) an agent whose worktrees hold work that never reached the git host (AGENT_HAS_LEFTOVER_WORK), whose daemon does not answer (AGENT_DAEMON_UNREACHABLE) or that is still busy (AGENT_BUSY). --force removes it anyway and throws the leftover work away.

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits workspaces agents prompt

Send a prompt to a work item's agent: said when its current turn ends (at once if it is idle), as its first turn, or to a yielded agent that resumes to hear it. An item with no agent is told so, and nothing is created. Send on an agent's Chat tab.

POST /workspaces/api/agent-dispatches/delivery with {workId, text, compactFirst: false}. It needs qits:admin or qits:admin-agent, which a person's token carries. qits:agent is refused (HTTP 403) by design: an agent keeps every read and loses the writes.

```
qits workspaces agents prompt [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>] [--workspaces-url <url>] <work> <text>
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `<work>` | The work item whose agent hears it: its qualified id (qits-123) or its id. |
| `<text>` | The prompt. |

| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects, where a work item's qualified id (qits-123) is looked up. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else derived from the idp address. |
| `--workspaces-url <url>` | The workspaces service's base URL, without /workspaces. Default: QITS_WORKSPACES_URL, else derived from the idp address, like the other services. |

### Examples

```
qits workspaces agents prompt qits-123 'The ticket moved to REVIEW.'
```

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits workspaces agents draft

An agent's saved prompt draft: what the prompt box on its Chat tab holds, kept on the service so it survives a reload and another device.

## qits workspaces agents draft show

The agent's saved prompt draft: its text and when it was written. An agent with none says so.

GET /workspaces/api/agents/{id}/prompt-draft (HTTP 404: nothing was composed). Any credential may read it, qits:agent included.

```
qits workspaces agents draft show [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>] [--workspaces-url <url>] <agent>
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `<agent>` | The agent's id. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): for a person. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed, with control characters written as escapes. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects, where a work item's qualified id (qits-123) is looked up. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else derived from the idp address. |
| `--workspaces-url <url>` | The workspaces service's base URL, without /workspaces. Default: QITS_WORKSPACES_URL, else derived from the idp address, like the other services. |

### Examples

```
qits workspaces agents draft show 00000000-0000-4000-8000-0000000000a1
```

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits workspaces agents draft save

Save the agent's prompt draft, as typing in its prompt box does. The draft holds the text and no picked file ranges.

PUT /workspaces/api/agents/{id}/prompt-draft with {content: '{"text":<text>,"picked":[]}', serializedPrompt: <text, trimmed>}. It needs qits:admin or qits:admin-agent, which a person's token carries. qits:agent is refused (HTTP 403) by design: an agent keeps every read and loses the writes.

```
qits workspaces agents draft save [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>] [--workspaces-url <url>] <agent> <text>
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `<agent>` | The agent's id. |
| `<text>` | The draft's text. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): for a person. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed, with control characters written as escapes. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects, where a work item's qualified id (qits-123) is looked up. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else derived from the idp address. |
| `--workspaces-url <url>` | The workspaces service's base URL, without /workspaces. Default: QITS_WORKSPACES_URL, else derived from the idp address, like the other services. |

### Examples

```
qits workspaces agents draft save 00000000-0000-4000-8000-0000000000a1 'Check the rounding.'
```

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits workspaces agents draft discard

Delete the agent's saved prompt draft: Discard on a restored draft.

DELETE /workspaces/api/agents/{id}/prompt-draft. It needs qits:admin or qits:admin-agent, which a person's token carries. qits:agent is refused (HTTP 403) by design: an agent keeps every read and loses the writes.

```
qits workspaces agents draft discard [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>] [--workspaces-url <url>] <agent>
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|

## qits workspaces agents chat

Read the agent's conversation: its harness command's transcript, in order. The agent's Chat tab, without the live socket.

The command is the agent's last harness command (GET /workspaces/container/{slot}/agent-worktrees/{agentId}), unless --command names one; then GET /workspaces/container/{slot}/commands/{commandId}/log?channel=TRANSCRIPT. With -o json, the transcript as the daemon answers it. It goes through qits-workspaces' container proxy to the slot's daemon. A person, qits:system, qits:admin or qits:admin-agent may reach any slot; qits:agent only its own workspace's.

```
qits workspaces agents chat --workspace <n> [--command <id>] [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>] [--workspaces-url <url>] <agent>

- `1` The platform refused, cannot be reached, or the agent has no harness command.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits workspaces agents terminate

End the agent's running harness command: Terminate on a live chat.

POST /workspaces/container/{slot}/prompt-refinements with {transcript, preamble?}. It goes through qits-workspaces' container proxy to the slot's daemon. A person, qits:system, qits:admin or qits:admin-agent may reach any slot; qits:agent only its own workspace's.

```
qits workspaces agents refine --workspace <n> [--output table|json] [--preamble <text>] [--projects-url <url>] [--workspaces-url <url>] <notes>
```

| Name | What it does |

## qits workspaces agents harness

The agent's harness on its slot's daemon: its last command, whether it still runs, and as a terminal or a chat. What the Terminal and Chat tabs attach to.

With --attach, a harness that runs as a terminal is attached to at once, as `qits workspaces attach <command> --workspace <n>` does (Ctrl-] detaches); a chat is refused, since `qits workspaces agents chat` reads it.

GET /workspaces/container/{slot}/agent-worktrees/{agentId}, then GET /workspaces/container/{slot}/commands. With -o json, {worktree, command}: the first answer and the command's entry of the second. It goes through qits-workspaces' container proxy to the slot's daemon. A person, qits:system, qits:admin or qits:admin-agent may reach any slot; qits:agent only its own workspace's.

```
qits workspaces agents harness --workspace <n> [--attach] [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>] [--workspaces-url <url>] <agent>
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `<agent>` | The agent's id. |
| `--workspace <n>` | Required. The agent's slot: its number, as `qits workspaces agents list` shows it. |
| `--attach` | Attach to the harness's terminal once it is found, until it ends or Ctrl-] detaches. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): for a person. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed, with control characters written as escapes. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects, where a work item's qualified id (qits-123) is looked up. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else derived from the idp address. |
| `--workspaces-url <url>` | The workspaces service's base URL, without /workspaces. Default: QITS_WORKSPACES_URL, else derived from the idp address, like the other services. |

### Examples

```
qits workspaces agents harness 00000000-0000-4000-8000-0000000000a1 --workspace 1
qits workspaces agents harness 00000000-0000-4000-8000-0000000000a1 --workspace 1 --attach
```

- --attach needs a terminal for typing, and the MCP service refuses it; without a terminal it streams what the harness prints, read-only.

### Exit codes

- `0` Done; with --attach, the command ended or you detached.
- `1` The platform refused or cannot be reached; with --attach, the agent has no terminal to attach to, or the connection could not be kept.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

The agent's worktree, as its Files tab shows it: the tree, one file, and the frameworks and test links the tab draws.

## qits workspaces agents files list

The agent's worktree: without --path the whole tree, every gitignored directory a stub with its entry count; with --path that directory, one level deep.

GET /workspaces/container/{slot}/agent-worktrees/{agentId}/files[?path=]. It goes through qits-workspaces' container proxy to the slot's daemon. A person, qits:system, qits:admin or qits:admin-agent may reach any slot; qits:agent only its own workspace's.

```
qits workspaces agents files list --workspace <n> [--output table|json] [--path <dir>] [--projects-url <url>] [--workspaces-url <url>] <agent>

## qits workspaces agents files read

One file of the agent's worktree, its text. A binary file, or one over the daemon's 2 MB cap, is not shown.

GET /workspaces/container/{slot}/agent-worktrees/{agentId}/files/content?path=. In the table form each line is made safe for a terminal (a tab becomes a space); -o json keeps the text exact. It goes through qits-workspaces' container proxy to the slot's daemon. A person, qits:system, qits:admin or qits:admin-agent may reach any slot; qits:agent only its own workspace's.

## qits workspaces agents sign-in status

Each harness of the slot's daemon, whether it is signed in, and the daemon's hint when it is not.

GET /workspaces/container/{slot}/agents/available. It goes through qits-workspaces' container proxy to the slot's daemon. A person, qits:system, qits:admin or qits:admin-agent may reach any slot; qits:agent only its own workspace's.

```
qits workspaces agents sign-in status --workspace <n> [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>] [--workspaces-url <url>]

## qits workspaces agents sign-in open

Start a harness's sign-in in the slot's container: Open the sign-in terminal. It is an interactive terminal: --attach attaches this one to it at once, or `qits workspaces attach <command> --workspace <n>` later, with the command id this prints. The agent's Terminal tab in the landing app shows the same terminal.

POST /workspaces/container/{slot}/agents/sign-in with {agentType} for --harness, else {}; the answer's command.id is the terminal's command. It goes through qits-workspaces' container proxy to the slot's daemon. A person, qits:system, qits:admin or qits:admin-agent may reach any slot; qits:agent only its own workspace's.

## qits workspaces runners

The workspace runners, the nodes slots are placed on: list them with their connection, slots, health and node login, read a runner's newest health check, update its slots, description and memory caps, lift a quarantine, ask for a health check or a login check, and delete one. The Runners page.

A runner is named by its id (`qits workspaces runners list -o json` shows it).

### Notes

- Reading, and asking for a health check, are open to qits:agent. update, greenlight and delete need qits:admin, qits:admin-agent or qits:system; login-check needs qits:admin or qits:admin-agent. qits:agent is refused those (HTTP 403) by design.
- Registering a runner and rotating its registration token are the landing app's only: their answer is a one-time token, and qits never prints a token.

## qits workspaces runners list

Every runner: connected or not, version, slots (running, owned, queued), quarantine, the last health check and the node's agent login.

GET /workspaces/api/runners. Any credential may read it, qits:agent included.

```
qits workspaces runners list [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>] [--workspaces-url <url>]
```

| Name | What it does |

## qits workspaces runners update

Change a runner's slots, description or memory caps: Save on a runner. Only what is given is sent; a memory cap reaches the next workspace launched on it, never a running one.

PATCH /workspaces/api/runners/{id} with {slots?, description?, workspaceMemoryLimit?, workspaceMemorySwapLimit?}. It needs qits:admin, qits:admin-agent or qits:system, which a person's token carries. qits:agent is refused (HTTP 403) by design.

```
qits workspaces runners update [--description <text>] [--memory <size>] [--memory-swap <size>] [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>] [--slots <n>] [--workspaces-url <url>] <runner>
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `<runner>` | The runner's id. |
| `--description <text>` | Free text. |
| `--memory <size>` | The --memory its workspace containers get, a docker size such as 12g (at least 6m). |
| `--memory-swap <size>` | Their --memory-swap: memory plus swap, at least --memory; or -1 for unlimited swap. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): for a person. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed, with control characters written as escapes. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects, where a work item's qualified id (qits-123) is looked up. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else derived from the idp address. |
| `--slots <n>` | How many workspaces it may run at once. |
| `--workspaces-url <url>` | The workspaces service's base URL, without /workspaces. Default: QITS_WORKSPACES_URL, else derived from the idp address, like the other services. |

### Examples

```
qits workspaces runners update 00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000020 --slots 2 --description 'The build machine under the desk'
qits workspaces runners update 00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000020 --memory 8g --memory-swap 8g
```

- --slots 0 drains the runner. A blank --description, --memory or --memory-swap clears it back to the default. --memory-swap -1 is unlimited swap.

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits workspaces runners greenlight

Lift a runner's quarantine: Greenlight on a quarantined runner. The service quarantines a runner itself, after a failed health check.

POST /workspaces/api/runners/{id}/greenlight, no body. It needs qits:admin, qits:admin-agent or qits:system, which a person's token carries. qits:agent is refused (HTTP 403) by design.

```
qits workspaces runners greenlight [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>] [--workspaces-url <url>] <runner>
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `<runner>` | The runner's id. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): for a person. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed, with control characters written as escapes. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects, where a work item's qualified id (qits-123) is looked up. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else derived from the idp address. |
| `--workspaces-url <url>` | The workspaces service's base URL, without /workspaces. Default: QITS_WORKSPACES_URL, else derived from the idp address, like the other services. |

### Examples

```

```

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits workspaces runners healthcheck

Queue a health check on a connected runner's node: Run health check. The result arrives with a later `qits workspaces runners health`.

POST /workspaces/api/runners/{id}/healthcheck, no body (HTTP 202). Any credential may ask, qits:agent included.

```
qits workspaces runners healthcheck [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>] [--workspaces-url <url>] <runner>
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `<runner>` | The runner's id. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): for a person. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed, with control characters written as escapes. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects, where a work item's qualified id (qits-123) is looked up. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else derived from the idp address. |
| `--workspaces-url <url>` | The workspaces service's base URL, without /workspaces. Default: QITS_WORKSPACES_URL, else derived from the idp address, like the other services. |

### Examples

```
qits workspaces runners healthcheck 00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000020
```

- An offline runner is refused: HTTP 409 RUNNER_UNAVAILABLE.

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits workspaces runners login-check

Ask a connected runner to probe its node's agent login again: Re-check on a runner. The result shows in a later `qits workspaces runners list`.

POST /workspaces/api/runners/{id}/login-check, no body (HTTP 202). It needs qits:admin or qits:admin-agent, which a person's token carries. qits:agent is refused (HTTP 403) by design.

```
qits workspaces runners login-check [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>] [--workspaces-url <url>] <runner>
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `<runner>` | The runner's id. |

### Examples

```
qits workspaces runners login-check 00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000020
```

- An offline runner is refused: HTTP 409 RUNNER_UNAVAILABLE.

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits workspaces runners delete

Decommission a runner: Delete on a runner.

DELETE /workspaces/api/runners/{id}. It needs qits:admin, qits:admin-agent or qits:system, which a person's token carries. qits:agent is refused (HTTP 403) by design.

```
qits workspaces runners delete [--output table|json] [--projects-url <url>] [--workspaces-url <url>] <runner>
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `<runner>` | The runner's id. |
| `-o, --output table\|json` | table (the default): for a person. json: the service's answer, pretty-printed, with control characters written as escapes. |
| `--projects-url <url>` | The projects service's base URL, without /projects, where a work item's qualified id (qits-123) is looked up. Default: QITS_PROJECTS_URL, else derived from the idp address. |
| `--workspaces-url <url>` | The workspaces service's base URL, without /workspaces. Default: QITS_WORKSPACES_URL, else derived from the idp address, like the other services. |

### Examples

```
qits workspaces runners delete 00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000020
```

- A runner that still owns ACTIVE workspaces is refused (HTTP 409 RUNNER_OWNS_WORKSPACES); the message names their slots.

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` The platform refused (the message names the status), or cannot be reached.
- `2` Used wrongly, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits git-login

Sign this workstation in for Git pushes to the platform's git host, through the browser. Run it once; afterwards Git gets its token from `qits git-credential`.

The sign-in may push branches under refs/heads/external/ and nothing else. It is stored in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/qits/git.json, apart from the session of `qits login`.

```
qits git-login [--audience <audience>] [--configure] [--git-host <url>] [--idp-url <url>] [--no-browser] [--timeout <seconds>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--audience <audience>` | The audience of the token. Default: qits-platform, the one audience every platform service accepts. |
| `--configure` | Also run the two `git config --global` commands that make Git ask `qits git-credential` for this git host (and no other). |
| `--git-host <url>` | The git host's address. Default: QITS_GIT_HOST_URL, else the idp's host with `idp` swapped for `githost` (https://githost.qits.wohlben.eu). |
| `--idp-url <url>` | The idp's public base URL. Default: QITS_IDP_URL, else the idp of the `qits login` session, else https://idp.qits.<QITS_DOMAIN>/idp, else https://idp.qits.wohlben.eu/idp. |
| `--no-browser` | Only print the sign-in address; do not start a browser. |
| `--timeout <seconds>` | How long to wait for the browser to come back. Default: 300. |

### Examples

```
qits git-login --configure
git push <remote> HEAD:refs/heads/external/log-view
```

- The git host refuses a push to any other ref, main included. A push releases nothing: ask for a release with `qits release-request`.
- --configure sets the credential helper for the git host only; a global helper (for example for GitHub) stays.

### Exit codes

- `0` Signed in.
- `1` The sign-in did not complete (the browser did not come back in time, or the idp refused).
- `2` Used wrongly, or the git host cannot be worked out.

## qits git-credential

Git's credential helper for the platform's git host. Git runs it; a person does not.

On a workstation `qits git-login` sets it up: get prints that sign-in's access token, refreshing it first when needed. store is ignored. erase drops the cached access token and keeps the sign-in.

Inside the platform there is no sign-in and none is needed: get answers the injected git host (QITS_GIT_AUTH_HOST) from the container's own credential, and answers no other host. store and erase do nothing there, and no file is written.

With a workspace token (QITS_TOKEN) get answers https://githost.qits.<QITS_DOMAIN> with that token, and answers no other host; store and erase do nothing and no file is written.

```
qits git-credential <get|store|erase>
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `<get\|store\|erase>` | What Git asks for. |

### Examples

```
git config --global --get-all credential.https://githost.qits.wohlben.eu.helper
```

The example shows the workstation setup. Do not run `get` yourself: it prints a token on stdout, because that is Git's helper protocol.
Inside the platform Git is set up for every host at once, so the injected host is checked before anything is minted: the platform's bearer is never handed to a host someone else named.

### Exit codes

- `0` Done. For a host without a sign-in, and inside the platform for any host but the injected one, it prints nothing and Git asks its other helpers. A credential that cannot be had says why on stderr and still exits 0, so Git carries on.
- `1` The sign-in file cannot be read or written.
- `2` No action named.

## qits mcp-credential

The headers helper of Claude's MCP entry for the qits MCP server. Claude runs it; a person does not.

Prints {"Authorization":"Bearer <token>"} on stdout: inside the platform the container's own credential, on a workstation the session of `qits login`, refreshed first when needed, and with a workspace token (QITS_TOKEN) that token as it is.

Interim: once every workspace has a long-lived token of its own (qits-684) the entry carries it as a plain header and this command goes.

```
qits mcp-credential
```

### Examples

```
"qits": {"type": "http", "url": "http://dev-qits-platform-access-mcp-service:8080/mcp", "headersHelper": "qits mcp-credential"}
```

The example is the entry in Claude's MCP configuration. Do not run it yourself: it prints a token on stdout, because that is what a headers helper does.

With QITS_TOKEN set the header carries that token, so an entry rendered with this helper keeps working on a runner node; the url there is the public vhost, not the wire alias.

### Exit codes

- `0` Printed.
- `1` No token to be had (not signed in, the session ended, or the idp refused or cannot be reached): one line on stderr and nothing on stdout, so Claude connects without the header and is told 401.

## qits artifacts

The platform's artifacts store. `qits artifacts publish` is a CI release step's publish client: a maven module, an npm package, a contract package, an sbom, a docs bundle or a daemon binary.

## qits artifacts publish

Publish to qits-artifacts from a CI release step: a maven module or an npm package (built, hashed and uploaded here, optionally only if its content changed), a contract package, an sbom, a docs bundle, a release's changelog, or a daemon binary. This is the qits-publish client.

Every publish follows one rule, for every surface: absent, PUT it and say what landed; occupied with the same bytes, say so and succeed (a retried or replayed step must go green); occupied with different bytes, fail naming both digests (a coordinate must never come to mean two things); occupied and not comparable, warn and skip.

### Notes

- This command never signs in and never reads or writes what `qits login` keeps: it runs in a CI step container with no person. `qits login` and `qits git-login` do not apply to it.
- Only a CI run may publish to qits-artifacts, so every request carries a bearer. The token comes from the first of these the environment has: QITS_PUBLISH_TOKEN_COMMAND (an executable that prints a fresh token, re-run for every request), QITS_PUBLISH_TOKEN (a token), or QITS_COMMISSIONED_CLIENT_ID and QITS_COMMISSIONED_CLIENT_SECRET (minted at the idp). With none of them the request still goes out, unauthenticated, and the store answers 401: the store decides who may write, not this client.
- Started under the name `qits-publish` (its own file, or a symlink to `qits`), any command runs exactly as `qits artifacts publish <command>`: `qits-publish sbom submit ...` behaves as `qits artifacts publish sbom submit ...`. A hand-written pipeline may still call it that way.
- The store is https://registry.qits.$QITS_DOMAIN and the Maven Central cache https://mirror.qits.$QITS_DOMAIN; QITS_DOMAIN defaults to wohlben.eu. No other variable names an address: the hosted npm and maven repositories, the docs, sbom and daemon stores are fixed paths under the store's host.

### Exit codes

- `0` Published, or already published with the same bytes.
- `1` Refused, and re-running will not help: invalid arguments, a 4xx, or the coordinate already holds different bytes.
- `2` Could not ask, or could not be answered: the store unreachable, an I/O failure, or a 5xx. A step may retry a 2 and must not retry a 1.

## qits artifacts publish maven

Publish one maven module of the reactor at the working directory: its jar and a flattened pom, with the content hash. Prints exactly one line on stdout: `published <version>` or `unchanged since <version>`; the reasoning goes to stderr.

The pom uploaded is generated from the module's effective model: no parent, every version resolved, and only external dependencies. Every dependency on another module of the same reactor is bundled into the jar (classes, resources, META-INF/services merged; any other path present twice with different bytes is refused), unless --link names it: a linked sibling stays a pom dependency at the version decided for it in this release. A pom-packaging module is a product (a parent or BOM another repository consumes) and keeps its dependencyManagement.

With --if-changed the module is uploaded only when its content hash differs from the newest published version's. No published version, no stored hash, or another algorithm version all count as changed. A re-run at a version already published answers `published <version>` without uploading.

With --dry-run (needs --if-changed) nothing is uploaded: the line is `changed` where an upload would happen, else as above. qits-ci asks every member of a link: group this way first, so the group publishes together or not at all.

```
qits artifacts publish maven [--dry-run] [--if-changed] [--include <glob>...] [--link <groupId:artifactId>...] [--name <groupId:artifactId>...] [--path <dir>...] [--root <dir>...] [--sbom <file>...] [--version <version>...]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--dry-run` | Decide as --if-changed and upload nothing: print `changed` or `unchanged since <version>`. |
| `--if-changed` | Upload only when the content differs from the newest published version. |
| `--include <glob>...` | Hash only the jar entries matching one of these globs. Narrows the hash, never what is uploaded. Repeatable. |
| `--link <groupId:artifactId>...` | A reactor sibling that stays a pom dependency instead of being bundled. Repeatable. |
| `--name <groupId:artifactId>...` | The coordinate the entry declares. |
| `--path <dir>...` | The module's directory, relative to the reactor root. Default: `.`. |
| `--root <dir>...` | The reactor root, whose pom.xml lists the modules. Default: the working directory. |
| `--sbom <file>...` | The module's CycloneDX document, hashed with the content. Required with --if-changed. |
| `--version <version>...` | The release version. |

### Examples

```
qits artifacts publish maven --name eu.wohlben.qits:qits-registries-npm --path npm --sbom npm/target/sbom.json --link eu.wohlben.qits:qits-blobstore --if-changed --version 2026.1002.1
```

### Exit codes

- `0` Published, already published at this version with the same content, or unchanged.
- `1` Refused: bad arguments, a module that is not --name at --version, a bundling conflict, a 4xx, or this version already holds other content.
- `2` Could not ask: the store unreachable, an I/O failure, a 5xx, or an unreadable answer; never read as unchanged.

## qits artifacts publish npm

Publish one npm package from its built directory: the tarball is packed here (deterministic: sorted entries, fixed mode, owner and mtime) and PUT with the registry's publish document. Prints exactly one line on stdout: `published <version>` or `unchanged since <version>`; the reasoning goes to stderr.

package.json in --path must name --name at --version and must not be private. Every regular file is packed except node_modules/, .git/, .npmrc and the lockfiles, narrowed by "files" when the manifest has it (package.json, README* and LICENSE* always go in), else by a root .npmignore (ng-packagr writes one): its patterns drop files, package.json, README* and LICENSE* at the root still go in, and the .npmignore itself is never packed. With "files" the .npmignore is not read. A negation (!pattern) or a .npmignore below the root is refused.

A version below the registry's latest is a replay: it is published under the tag `replay` and leaves the real tags alone. Otherwise the `main` dist-tag is moved onto the version after the publish, on a re-run too.

With --if-changed the package is uploaded only when its content hash differs from the newest published version's (by version order, never the latest tag). The manifest's version field is not part of the hash.

```
qits artifacts publish npm [--if-changed] [--include <glob>...] [--name <package>...] [--path <dir>...] [--sbom <file>...] [--version <version>...]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--if-changed` | Upload only when the content differs from the newest published version. |
| `--include <glob>...` | Hash only the files matching one of these globs (paths inside the package). Narrows the hash, never what is uploaded. Repeatable. |
| `--name <package>...` | The npm package name. |
| `--path <dir>...` | The built package's directory, holding its package.json. Default: `.`. |
| `--sbom <file>...` | The package's CycloneDX document, hashed with the content. Required with --if-changed. |
| `--version <version>...` | The release version. |

### Examples

```
qits artifacts publish npm --name @qits/ui-components --path dist/qits-spa-ui-components --sbom sbom.json --if-changed --version 2026.1002.1
```

### Exit codes

- `0` Published, already published at this version with the same content, or unchanged.
- `1` Refused: bad arguments, a package.json that is not --name at --version, an unsupported .npmignore, a 4xx, or this version already holds other content.
- `2` Could not ask: the registry unreachable, an I/O failure, a 5xx, or an unreadable answer; never read as unchanged.

## qits artifacts publish npm plan

Retired by `qits artifacts publish npm`, which decides, builds and uploads in one call; kept until the build-only npm-library archetype is live everywhere.

Decide, in one word on stdout, what to do with package@version: publish (the ordinary case), skip (this exact version is already there; versions are immutable), or publish-replay (this version is below the registry's latest, so it must take a throwaway tag rather than move latest backwards).

Only the word goes to stdout; the reasoning goes to stderr, so `plan=$(qits artifacts publish npm plan ...)` captures just the word.

```
qits artifacts publish npm plan [--package <name>...] [--version <version>...]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--package <name>...` | The npm package name. |
| `--version <version>...` | The version. |

### Examples

```
plan=$(qits artifacts publish npm plan --package @qits/ui-components --version 2026.906.1)
```

### Exit codes

- `0` Decided (the word is on stdout).
- `1` Refused: bad arguments, or a 4xx.
- `2` Could not ask: the registry unreachable, an I/O failure, or a 5xx; never read as "publish".

## qits artifacts publish npm dist-tag

Point a dist-tag at a version. Always run, never guarded behind whether this run's publish happened: moving a tag onto the version it already names costs one request and succeeds.

```
qits artifacts publish npm dist-tag [--package <name>...] [--tag <tag>...] [--version <version>...]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--package <name>...` | The npm package name. |
| `--tag <tag>...` | The dist-tag to move. |
| `--version <version>...` | The version. |

### Examples

```
qits artifacts publish npm dist-tag --package @qits/ui-components --version 2026.906.1 --tag main
```

### Exit codes

- `0` The tag now names that version.
- `1` Refused: bad arguments, or a 4xx (for example a backwards move of latest).
- `2` Could not ask: the registry unreachable, an I/O failure, or a 5xx.

## qits artifacts publish contract

Pack a provider's golden masters or a consumer's pacts from a directory into one package (a maven jar or an npm tarball), and publish it if its content changed. Prints exactly one line on stdout: `published <version>` or `unchanged since <version>`.

The packages are built deterministically: the same tree gives the same bytes. Inside the package the files sit under golden-masters/ or pacts/, by --kind, whatever --from is called; the jar carries directory entries, because a class-path pact loader asks for the directory. Every contract package is if-changed, and decides on its own: packages built from the same tree agree without any link between them.

Golden masters pack the whole --from tree. Pacts pack only the top-level files of --from named <consumer>_<provider>.json for the --provider given (both repository names), so one flat pacts/ directory serves every provider.

--name is the coordinate qits-ci derived from the contracts: section; this command does not derive coordinates.

```
qits artifacts publish contract [--application <application>...] [--ecosystem <maven|npm>...] [--from <dir>...] [--kind <golden-masters|pacts>...] [--name <coordinate>...] [--provider <repository>...] [--version <version>...]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--application <application>...` | The application whose contracts these are; named in the package's description. |
| `--ecosystem <maven\|npm>...` | Which package to build. |
| `--from <dir>...` | The tree to pack. |
| `--kind <golden-masters\|pacts>...` | What the tree is. |
| `--name <coordinate>...` | groupId:artifactId for maven, the package name for npm. |
| `--provider <repository>...` | The provider a pact is with, by repository name: the pacts packed are --from's *_<provider>.json. Required for pacts, refused for golden masters. |
| `--version <version>...` | The release version. |

### Examples

```
qits artifacts publish contract --kind golden-masters --ecosystem maven --name eu.wohlben.qits:qits-projects-golden-masters --application qits-projects --from golden-masters/ --version 2026.1002.1
qits artifacts publish contract --kind pacts --ecosystem maven --name eu.wohlben.qits:qits-workspaces-service-pacts-qits-projects-service --application qits-workspaces --provider qits-projects-service --from pacts/ --version 2026.1002.1
```

### Exit codes

- `0` Published, already published at this version with the same content, or unchanged.
- `1` Refused: bad arguments, an empty --from (for pacts: no *_<provider>.json in it), a 4xx, or this version already holds other content.
- `2` Could not ask: the store unreachable, an I/O failure, a 5xx, or an unreadable answer; never read as unchanged.

## qits artifacts publish contract-docs

Publish the @contracts/<application> docs bundle when at least one golden-masters package is at --version: the tree under golden-masters/, plus contracts.json listing every --package with its newest version and whether that is this release. Prints exactly one line on stdout: `published <version>` or `unchanged` (no package moved; the docs store keeps the previous bundle).

Run it after the contract packages are published: a package with no version at all is a refusal, not a state.

```
qits artifacts publish contract-docs [--application <application>...] [--from <dir>...] [--meta <key=value>...] [--package <ecosystem=coordinate>...] [--version <version>...]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--application <application>...` | The provider application; the site is @contracts/<application>. |
| `--from <dir>...` | The golden-masters tree. |
| `--meta <key=value>...` | A metadata header, sent as X-Artifacts-Meta-<key>. Repeatable. |
| `--package <ecosystem=coordinate>...` | A golden-masters package, e.g. npm=@qits/projects-golden-masters. Repeatable. |
| `--version <version>...` | The release version. |

### Examples

```
qits artifacts publish contract-docs --application qits-projects --from golden-masters/ --package maven=eu.wohlben.qits:qits-projects-golden-masters --package npm=@qits/projects-golden-masters --version 2026.1002.1 --meta git.commit.hash=deadbeef
```

### Exit codes

- `0` Published, already published, or unchanged.
- `1` Refused: bad arguments, a package with no published version, or a 4xx.
- `2` Could not ask: the store unreachable, an I/O failure, or a 5xx.

## qits artifacts publish sbom

An SBOM: submit a document that already exists, or build one from a Dockerfile's FROM lines.

## qits artifacts publish sbom submit

Publish a CycloneDX document at (packageType, name, version).

```
qits artifacts publish sbom submit [--file <path>...] [--name <name>...] [--type <npm|maven|docker|daemon>...] [--version <version>...]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--file <path>...` | The CycloneDX document to publish. |
| `--name <name>...` | The package name. |
| `--type <npm\|maven\|docker\|daemon>...` | The package type the sbom store files this under. |

### Examples

```
qits artifacts publish sbom submit --type docker --name qits/qits-ci --version 2026.906.1 --file sbom.json
```

### Exit codes

- `0` Published, or already published with the same bytes.
- `1` Refused: bad arguments, a 4xx, or the coordinate already holds different bytes.
- `2` Could not ask: the store unreachable, an I/O failure, or a 5xx.

## qits artifacts publish sbom from-dockerfile

Build a CycloneDX document from a Dockerfile's FROM lines: one component per distinct upstream image. Publishes nothing itself: write the file with -o, then `sbom submit` it.

null-style variables in a FROM resolve from the file's own ARG default, or from --build-arg, in the precedence a real build has.

```
qits artifacts publish sbom from-dockerfile [--build-arg <NAME=value>...] [--dockerfile <path>...] [--output <path>...] [--root-name <name>...] [--root-version <version>...]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--build-arg <NAME=value>...` | A build argument, for a FROM that names one. Repeatable. |
| `--dockerfile <path>...` | A Dockerfile to read FROM lines from. Repeatable. Default: Dockerfile. |
| `-o, --output <path>...` | Where to write the document. Required, exactly once. |
| `--root-name <name>...` | The image's own name, for the document's root component. |
| `--root-version <version>...` | The image's own version. |

### Examples

```
qits artifacts publish sbom from-dockerfile --root-name qits/qits-ci --root-version 2026.906.1 -o sbom.json
qits artifacts publish sbom from-dockerfile --root-name x --root-version 1 --dockerfile a.Dockerfile --dockerfile b.Dockerfile --build-arg BASE=alpine:3.20 -o sbom.json
```

### Exit codes

- `0` Wrote the document.
- `1` Refused: bad arguments, a Dockerfile with no FROM line, or a variable nothing resolves.

## qits artifacts publish docs

A documentation bundle, at (site, version).

## qits artifacts publish docs submit

Publish a documentation bundle at (site, version).

--openapi publishes one OpenAPI document instead of an archive: it is packed as the bundle's only entry, openapi.yml (or openapi.json for a .json file). That is the platform's @apidocs publish.

The store explodes the archive into per-file blobs and keeps no archive digest, so an occupied version cannot be verified: it is skipped, with a WARN naming the degradation, rather than reported as a plain success.

```
qits artifacts publish docs submit [--archive <tgz>...] [--meta <key=value>...] [--openapi <file>...] [--site <name>...] [--version <version>...]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--archive <tgz>...` | The gzipped tar archive to publish. Exclusive with --openapi. |
| `--meta <key=value>...` | A metadata header, sent as X-Artifacts-Meta-<key>. Repeatable. |
| `--openapi <file>...` | An OpenAPI document (.yml, .yaml or .json) to publish as the whole bundle. Exclusive with --archive. |
| `--site <name>...` | The docs site's name. |
| `--version <version>...` | The version. |

### Examples

```
qits artifacts publish docs submit --site @apidocs/qits-ci --version 2026.906.1 --archive apidocs.tgz --meta git.commit.hash=deadbeef
qits artifacts publish docs submit --site @apidocs/qits-projects --version 2026.1002.1 --openapi docs/openapi.yml
```

### Exit codes

- `0` Published, or already published (see above: not verified in that case).
- `1` Refused: bad arguments, or a 4xx that is not the store's "already there".
- `2` Could not ask: the store unreachable, an I/O failure, or a 5xx.

## qits artifacts publish changelog

Write this release's CHANGELOG.md and publish it as the docs site @changelog/<repository> at --version. Run in a release's publish step.

The release comes from QITS_EVENT_PAYLOAD (its repository, repositoryName, releaseRequestId, releaseRequestQualifiedId and occurredAt); the commits from the release request in qits-projects, oldest first and without the request's own merge commits, after those of every earlier release cut since the newest one that published a changelog (a release whose publish never completed has none of its own); the tickets from the commits' subjects (`feat(qits-9, qits-10): ...`), titled by qits-projects; and the report highlights from the gate run's reports in qits-ci (QITS_CI_RUN_ID), when it has any.

The second line's time is the payload's occurredAt, or QITS_EVENT_OCCURRED_AT when the payload has none; both are optional, and a value that does not parse as an ISO-8601 time is dropped rather than refused, so the line is left without a time instead.

The last line is always `associated tickets:` followed by every ticket that exists, as `qits-9`; `qits changelog bump-message` reads it back.

The bundle is a .tar.gz with one entry, CHANGELOG.md, published like `docs submit` with the given --meta, release.request.id=<uuid> and, when the event names it, release.request.qualified-id=<repository>-rr-<n>. An occupied version is skipped, as there.

```
qits artifacts publish changelog [--meta <key=value>...] [--version <version>...]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--meta <key=value>...` | A metadata header, sent as X-Artifacts-Meta-<key>. Repeatable. |
| `--version <version>...` | The release's version. |

### Examples

```
qits artifacts publish changelog --version "$QITS_VERSION" --meta git.commit.hash="$QITS_CI_SHA" --meta git.repository.name="$QITS_CI_REPO_NAME"
```

- qits-projects is https://projects.qits.$QITS_DOMAIN and qits-ci https://ci.qits.$QITS_DOMAIN; a ticket links to https://qits.$QITS_DOMAIN/projects/<slug>/work/detail/<id>.
- A ticket qits-projects does not know is listed as (no such work item), without a link, and left out of the last line.
- Changelogs are kept for good for now; nothing deletes one with its release.

### Exit codes

- `0` Published, or already published (not verified, as for docs submit).
- `1` Refused: bad arguments, QITS_EVENT_PAYLOAD or QITS_CI_RUN_ID missing or incomplete, the release request unknown, or a 4xx from the store.
- `2` Could not ask: a service unreachable, an I/O failure, or a 5xx.

## qits artifacts publish daemon

A daemon binary, at (name, version).

## qits artifacts publish daemon submit

Publish a daemon binary at (name, version).

Daemon versions are immutable: a re-publish always answers 409, even for identical bytes. The stored digest decides whether that is a re-fire of a run that already succeeded, or two builds claiming one version.

```
qits artifacts publish daemon submit [--file <bin>...] [--name <name>...] [--version <version>...]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--file <bin>...` | The binary to publish. |
| `--name <name>...` | The daemon's name. |
| `--version <version>...` | The version. |

### Examples

```
qits artifacts publish daemon submit --name qits-platform-access-cli --version 2026.906.1 --file target/qits
```

### Exit codes

- `0` Published, or already published with the same bytes.
- `1` Refused: bad arguments, a 4xx, or the coordinate already holds different bytes.
- `2` Could not ask: the store unreachable, an I/O failure, or a 5xx.

## qits artifacts publish exists

Ask whether a coordinate is already published: daemon, docs, npm or sbom.

An sbom coordinate has two name parts, written <packageType>/<packageName>, for example docker/qits/qits-ci. A step that read an unreachable store as "absent" would republish on every outage, and one that read it as "present" would skip a publish that never happened, so a third exit code says "could not ask" instead.

```
qits artifacts publish exists [<type> <name> <version>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `<type> <name> <version>` | The type (daemon, docs, npm or sbom), the name, and the version, in that order. |

### Examples

```
qits artifacts publish exists daemon qits-platform-access-cli 2026.906.1
qits artifacts publish exists sbom docker/qits/qits-ci 2026.906.1
qits artifacts publish exists npm @qits/ui-components 2026.906.1
```

### Exit codes

- `0` Published.
- `1` Not published, or the arguments are wrong.
- `2` Could not ask: the store unreachable, an I/O failure, or a 5xx.

## qits changelog

Release changelogs, as the docs store keeps them (@changelog/<repository>, one CHANGELOG.md per version). bump-message writes a dependency bump's commit message from them, in a CI step.

## qits changelog bump-message

Print the commit message of a dependency-bump step: `bump(<group>): <N> dependencies`, the step's body, and the changelogs of every version the applied changes upgrade to, with the tickets those changelogs name in the subject's scope.

N is the number of lines in --applied. The changelogs come from the docs store (@changelog/<repository> at each version, CHANGELOG.md), for the changes in QITS_EVENT_PAYLOAD's changes[] that carry `changelog: {repository, versions}` and are listed in --applied; repositories by name, versions in version order. With no changelog to read the message is the subject and the body alone.

```
qits changelog bump-message [--applied <file>] [--body <file>] [--group <group>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--applied <file>` | The changes this step applied, one `<ecosystem><TAB><name>` per line. |
| `--body <file>` | The step's body, printed as it is. |
| `--group <group>` | The bump's group, as in `bump(<group>)`. |

### Examples

```
qits changelog bump-message --group targeted --applied applied.tsv --body body.txt > message.txt
```

- --applied holds one `<ecosystem><TAB><name>` line per change the step applied; --body the step's own lines (`- maven g:a 1 -> 2 (pom.xml)`), printed as they are.
- With tickets the subject is `chore(qits-9, qits-10): bump(<group>): <N> dependencies`, the ids sorted by project and number.
- The store is https://registry.qits.$QITS_DOMAIN; the bearer comes from QITS_PUBLISH_TOKEN_COMMAND, QITS_PUBLISH_TOKEN, or the commissioned pair, as for `qits artifacts publish`.

### Exit codes

- `0` The message is on stdout.
- `1` Refused: an option or QITS_EVENT_PAYLOAD missing or unreadable, no credential in the environment, a changelog that is not published (404) or whose last line is not `associated tickets: ...`, or another 4xx.
- `2` Could not ask: the store unreachable, a 5xx, or a token command or idp that failed. A step may retry a 2.

## qits agents

What an agent harness runs on this machine, one group per harness. A person does not run these.

## qits agents claude

What Claude Code runs.

## qits agents claude hook

Claude Code's hooks. Each is registered in Claude's settings.json; the help of each shows how.

## qits agents claude hook work-links

Claude Code's MessageDisplay hook: shows work ids such as qits-111 in Claude's messages as links to the landing app's work item page. Claude runs it; a person does not.

It reads one batch of the message on stdin and prints the text to show, or nothing when no id was linked. Only the screen changes: the transcript and the model keep the plain id. An id inside a word, a branch (ticket/qits-1152), a longer name (qits-1152-x), a link, inline code or a code block stays as it is. Any error prints nothing and exits 0, so Claude shows the original text.

The project slugs are cached for an hour in $XDG_CACHE_HOME/qits/work-links.json (default ~/.cache/qits/). A stale cache is used as it is while a refresh runs in the background, with this home's credential; until the first one is done only `qits` ids are linked.

```
qits agents claude hook work-links [--landing-url <url>] [--style <style>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--landing-url <url>` | The landing app's base URL. Default: QITS_LANDING_URL, else the platform's bare domain. |
| `--style <style>` | markdown ([qits-111](url)) or osc8 (a terminal hyperlink). Default: QITS_LINK_STYLE, else markdown. |

### Examples

```
{"hooks": {"MessageDisplay": [{"hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "qits agents claude hook work-links", "timeout": 5}]}]}}
```

The example is the entry in Claude's settings.json (~/.claude/settings.json).

- The landing app is the platform's bare domain: on a workstation the session's idp address without `idp.`, elsewhere https://qits.<QITS_DOMAIN>. --landing-url or QITS_LANDING_URL sets it.
- QITS_LINK_STYLE=osc8 is the same as --style osc8. QITS_LINK_PROJECTS (comma-separated slugs) replaces the cache.

### Exit codes

- `0` Always, also when nothing was printed.

## qits agents claude statusline

Claude Code's status lines. Each is registered in Claude's settings.json; the help of each shows how.

## qits agents claude statusline work-items

Claude Code's status line: the work items this session spoke of most recently, newest first, each with its status square and block glyph and linked to the landing app (OSC 8). Claude runs it; a person does not.

It reads Claude's status line JSON on stdin and the end of the transcript it names, where ids count from Claude's text and from tool results, by the same rules as `qits agents claude hook work-links`. It prints one line, or nothing when there is no id. The squares are the session names' palette; a red mark in front means blocked, and an interrobang that the item's agent is waiting on a person.

Each id's status is cached for 60 seconds in $XDG_CACHE_HOME/qits/work-states.json (default ~/.cache/qits/). What is cached shows at once, an id with nothing cached shows without a mark, and one background refresh asks the projects service for the stale ids with this home's credential. Any error prints the ids without marks, or nothing; the exit is 0.

```
qits agents claude statusline work-items [--landing-url <url>] [--limit <n>]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--landing-url <url>` | The landing app's base URL. Default: QITS_LANDING_URL, else the platform's bare domain. |
| `--limit <n>` | How many ids to show. Default: 5. |

### Examples

```
"statusLine": {"type": "command", "command": "qits agents claude statusline work-items", "refreshInterval": 30}
```

The example is the entry in Claude's settings.json (~/.claude/settings.json).

- Your own status line script can run it too: pass the JSON it was given on stdin and print the line it prints.
- The landing app and the project slugs are found as `qits agents claude hook work-links` finds them, with the same --landing-url, QITS_LANDING_URL and QITS_LINK_PROJECTS.

### Exit codes

- `0` Always, also when nothing was printed.

## qits update

Updates qits on this workstation to the newest released version, and says what it did.

It asks qits-artifacts for the newest version with the session of `qits login`, downloads it next to the running binary, checks its length, its sha256 digest and that it answers `-V` with that version, and then puts it in place of the running binary in one rename. Any failure leaves the installed qits as it was.

qits also does this by itself: a signed-in qits on a workstation checks at most once an hour, in the background, so no command waits for it. A failure there is one line on stderr of the next command. `qits -V` prints the version this binary is.

Only on a workstation: inside the platform, in a workspace with QITS_TOKEN and in the MCP service the image decides which qits there is, and this refuses.

```
qits update [--artifacts-url <url>] [--check]
```

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--artifacts-url <url>` | qits-artifacts' base URL. Default: QITS_ARTIFACTS_URL, else from the session's idp address. |
| `--check` | Only say whether a newer version is released; download nothing. |

### Examples

```
qits update
qits update --check
QITS_AUTO_UPDATE=false qits projects list
```

- QITS_AUTO_UPDATE=false (or 0, off, no) turns the automatic update off; `qits update` still works.
- Where the binary's directory is not writable, the new version is downloaded and checked into $XDG_CACHE_HOME/qits/ (default ~/.cache/qits/), and the command to install it (`sudo install -m 755 ...`) is printed.
- The store's address is https://registry.qits.<domain>, from the session's idp address; --artifacts-url or QITS_ARTIFACTS_URL sets it.

### Exit codes

- `0` Up to date, updated, or (with --check) a newer version reported.
- `1` Not updated: the store refused or cannot be reached, a download failed its checks, the directory is not writable, or this build cannot update itself. The message says which.
- `2` Used wrongly, not on a workstation, not signed in, or the session ended (run `qits login`).

## qits tui

Pick a command instead of remembering it: an interactive screen over every qits command.

The upper half is the picker: the commands, then the options of the one chosen, with the values the platform can offer. The command being built is shown between the halves, so the screen also teaches the command line. The lower half is the output of what was run.

```
qits tui
```

### Examples

```
qits tui
```

- Keys: arrows or k/j move, Enter chooses, Esc goes back, / filters, Ctrl-R runs, Ctrl-C stops a run, Ctrl-P shows this session's history, q quits.
- Needs an interactive terminal of at least 80x24. In a pipe or a CI step it says so and exits 2.
- It runs a command by starting this same binary again, so a run behaves exactly as it does when typed.

### Exit codes

- `0` Done.
- `1` Unused.
- `2` There is no interactive terminal, or it is smaller than 80x24.
