/**
 * The wire, and the only place in this program that knows there is one.
 *
 * <p>{@code java.net.http}, no client library: the four surfaces this speaks to are plain PUT/GET/HEAD
 * with a body and a couple of headers, and the JDK's client is already in the image.
 *
 * <p><b>Every request carries a bearer, because only a CI run may publish.</b> qits-artifacts used to
 * answer an anonymous publish and no longer does: the store refuses one, so a request without an
 * {@code Authorization} header is a 401 rather than a coordinate. {@link PublishCredential} decides
 * where the token comes from — a token command, a token, or the commissioned client pair minted at
 * the idp — and this class puts it on the wire. The reads go out with it too: the store has wanted a
 * bearer to <em>read</em> a daemon binary for some time, so an unauthenticated probe was only ever a
 * 401 waiting to be met.
 *
 * <p><b>A request with no credential is still sent.</b> When the environment holds no token at all
 * the header is simply absent and the call happens anyway — the store is the authority on who may
 * write, and refusing here would replace its 401, which names the real reason, with a client-side
 * error naming a variable.
 *
 * <p>Machine auth arriving for every surface at once is why the HTTP lives here: it became one
 * release of this binary rather than a sweep of forty pipelines.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing here ever prints a request header.</b> A failure names the method, the address and
 * the response — never what was sent, because what was sent is a token.
 *
 * <p>Every transport failure becomes {@link ExitCode#TRANSPORT}: the caller could not ask, which is
 * a different fact from being refused, and a release step is entitled to retry one and not the
 * other.
