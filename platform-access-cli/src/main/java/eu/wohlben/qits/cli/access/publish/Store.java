/**
 * Where qits-artifacts is, and how a coordinate becomes a URL.
 *
 * <p><b>No address is spelled in a repository.</b> Every root arrives as environment, and this class
 * is the one place that turns those roots plus a declared coordinate into a path — which is exactly
 * the consolidation the release-slots plan is for: the fleet derived the SBOM base by chopping three
 * different variables three different ways, and the three spellings disagreed about the trailing
 * slash.
 *
 * <h2>The roots</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code QITS_ARTIFACTS_URL} — the store's origin, and the only variable this program wants.
 *       qits-ci injects it into every step container.
 *   <li>{@code QITS_DOCS_URL} — the docs root <em>including</em> its {@code docs} repository
 *       segment, because the docs wire has one and the sbom and daemon wires do not. Derived from
 *       the origin when absent.
 *   <li>{@code QITS_NPM_REGISTRY_URL} / {@code QITS_NPM_PROXY_URL} — the hosted npm registry the
 *       {@code @qits} scope lives in, and the pull-through cache everything else resolves through.
 *       Two services since the byte plane was split, so neither can be derived from the other.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>The one derivation, and why it is still here</h2>
 *
 * <p>A deployment whose qits-ci has not yet been taught {@code QITS_ARTIFACTS_URL} still injects the
 * npm and maven registry roots, and the store is a sibling path inside the same service — which is
 * precisely the {@code ${QITS_NPM_REGISTRY_URL%%/artifacts/*}} chop the fleet hand-wrote thirty
 * times. It survives here, once, behind a WARN: one derivation in one binary is the plan's answer,
 * and deleting it before every deployment carries the variable would make this binary useless in the
 * containers that need it first — including the ones that publish this binary.
